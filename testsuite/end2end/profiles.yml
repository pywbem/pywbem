# This file defines discovery-related characteristics of management
# profiles. It is used by pywbem end2end testcases.
#
# The format is a list of profile definition items, where each item describes
# one profile. The order of profile definition items determines the order in
# which the profiles are tested.
#
# Each profile definition item is a dictionary with the following items.
# Unless otherwise stated, the items are required to be specified:
# * registered_org: Registered organization of the profile (as a string, e.g.
#   'SNIA').
# * registered_name: Registered name of the profile.
# * autonomous: Boolean indicating whether the profile is autonomous.
# * reference_direction: Scoping profile reference direction: 'dmtf' or 'snia',
#   or null to use the registered_org. Optional, defaults to null.
# * central_class: Class name of the central class of the profile.
# * scoping_class: Class name of the scoping class of the profile. May be
#   null or non-null for autonomous profiles. Optional, defaults to null.
# * scoping_path: Iterable of class names of the scoping path (from central to
#   scoping, excluding central and scoping classes). Must be null for
#   autonomous profiles. Optional, defaults to null.
# * doc: Informal reference to the standards document describing the profile.
#
# TODO #1554: Add support for representing profile versions.

  # Note: Special case: The 'SMI-S' profile is actually a registered
  #       specification, and thus does not have central class, scoping class,
  #       or scoping path. However, it is advertised like a profile via
  #       CIM_RegisteredProfile, which has CIM_ElementConformsToProfile to
  #       autonomous profiles that conform to the specific version of SMI-S.

  # Note: History: The SNIA 'Server' profile has been deprecated in
  #       SMI-S 1.7, listing the DMTF 'WBEM Server' profile as a replacement.
  #       There is an intention in the SMI-S community to change this again,
  #       allowing the SNIA 'Server' profile and the DMTF 'WBEM Server' profile
  #       to be implemented. However, as of the current SMI-S 1.8 Revision 3,
  #       the SNIA 'Server' profile is still listed as deprecated. Note that
  #       deprecated profiles must still be implemented in SMI-S.
  # Note: Special case: For historical reasons, this profile is a special case
  #       in that the profile is defined as autonomous in the SMI-S 1.8
  #       standard, but its scoping class CIM_System is different from its
  #       central class CIM_ObjectManager. That violates the DMTF definition of
  #       autonomous, and requires treating the profile like a component
  #       profile for discovery purposes. Discussion with Mike Walker revealed
  #       that the profile is supposed to remain an autonomous profile, and in
  #       order to support the corresponding discovery, its scoping class
  #       should be changed to CIM_ObjectManager in a future version of the
  #       SMI-S standard. For now, the profile definition in this file will
  #       represent the SMI-S 1.8 situation.

# Note: History on all SNIA indications related profiles:
#       * The SNIA 'Indication' profile already existed in SMI.S 1.2 as stable.
#       * SMI-S 1.5 (or 1.4?) introduced a SNIA 'Experimental Indication'
#         profile as experimental, that specializes the SNIA 'Indication'
#         profile.
#       * SMI-S 1.6 introduced a SNIA 'Indications' profile as experimental,
#         that specializes the DMTF 'Indications' profile (DSP1054), and also
#         deprecated the two earlier profiles, with the new SNIA 'Indications'
#         profile as a replacement.
#       * In SMI-S 1.7, the two earlier profiles were removed from the
#         standard (the chapter about the SNIA 'Indication' profile still
#         exists and contains a reference to the respective chapter in
#         SMI-S 1.6). Also, the SNIA 'Indications' profile was removed again
#         (the respective chapter still exists and contains a reference to the
#         DMTF 'Indications' profile).
# Note: The profile definitions below do not include the SNIA 'Experimental
#       Indication' profile and the SNIA 'Indications' profile because they
#       were removed while still being experimental.
