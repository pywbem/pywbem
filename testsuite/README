This directory contains the tests for PyWBEM.  You should try and run
them if you are doing development on the code.

There are two types of test:

1. Automatic unit tests.

   These tests are run by executing (one level up from here):

       $ make test

   Or by executing (in this directory):

       $ py.test

2. Manual test: run_cim_operations.py.

   To run the CIM operations tests against a real WBEM server, use the
   run_cim_operations.py script. Invoke it with --help for usage.

   The test.mof file must be loaded into the repository of the
   WBEM server that is used for that test.  Under OpenPegasus, this done
   by setting the repositoryIsDefaultProvider configuration variable to
   true, and my loading the file, as follows:

       $ cimconfig -s repositoryIsDefaultInstanceProvider=true -p
       $ cimmof < test.mof

   OpenPegasus must be restarted in order for the change to take effect.
