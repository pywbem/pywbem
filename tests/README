Testing
-------

All of the following `make` commands run the tests in the currently active
Python environment. Depending on how the `pywbem` package is installed in that
Python environment, either the `pywbem` and `pywbem_mock` directories in the
main repository directory are used, or the installed `pywbem` package.
The test case files and any utility functions they use are always used from
the `tests` directory in the main repository directory.

The `tests` directory has the following subdirectory structure:

    tests
     +-- unittest            Unit tests
     |    +-- utils               Utility functions used by unit tests
     |    +-- pywbem              Unit tests for the pywbem package
     |    +-- pywbem_mock         Unit tests for the pywbem_mock package
     |    +-- unittest_utils      Unit tests for tests/unittest/utils
     |    +-- functiontest        Unit tests for tests/functiontest
     |    +-- end2endtest_utils   Unit tests for tests/end2endtest/utils
     |    +-- servers             Unit tests for tests/servers
     +-- functiontest        Function tests
     +-- end2endtest         End2end tests
     |    +-- utils               Utility functions used by end2end tests
     +-- manualtest          Manual tests
     +-- servers             WBEM server definition file used by some tests and module
     |                         for accessing it
     +-- profiles            Simple definitions of management profiles used by some tests
     +-- schema              The CIM schema MOF files used by some MOF tests
     +-- dtd                 The CIM DTD file used by some CIM-XML validation tests

There are multiple types of tests in pywbem:

1. Unit tests and function tests

   These tests do not require any WBEM server to be available, and the tests
   validate their results automatically.

   The distinction between unit tests and function tests as used in pywbem is
   that function tests exercise the entire pywbem client component or entire
   pywbem scripts, while unit tests exercise single modules.

   They are run by executing:

       $ make test

   Test execution can be modified by a number of environment variables, as
   documented in the make help (execute `make help`).

2. End2end tests

   These tests are run against one or more WBEM servers, and the tests validate
   their results automatically.

   They are run by preparing a server definition file:

       tests/servers/server_file.yml

   from the provided example, and by executing:

       $ make end2end

   Again, test execution can be modified by a number of environment variables,
   as documented in the make help (execute `make help`).

3. Manual tests

   There are several Python scripts and shell scripts that can be run manually.
   The results need to be validated manually.

   These scripts are in the directory:

       tests/manualtest/

   and are executed by simply invoking them from within the main directory
   of the repository, e.g.:

       tests/manualtest/run_cim_operations.py

   Some of the scripts support a `--help` option that informs about their
   usage.

   The `run_cim_operations.py` script needs a particular MOF file loaded in the
   repository of the WBEM server that is used for the test. This can be done
   using the MOF compiler of pywbem:

       $ mof_compiler -s <target_url> tests/unittest/pywbem/test.mof

To run the unit and function tests in all supported Python environments, the
Tox tool can be used. It creates the necessary virtual Python environments and
executes `make test` (i.e. the unit and function tests) in each of them.

For running Tox, it does not matter which Python environment is currently
active, as long as the Python `tox` package is installed in it:

    $ tox                              # Run tests on all supported Python versions
    $ tox -e py27                      # Run tests on Python 2.7
