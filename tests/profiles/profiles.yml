# This file defines discovery-related characteristics of management
# profiles and registered specifications. It is used by pywbem end2end
# testcases.
#
# The format is a list of profile definition items, where each item describes
# one management profile or registered specification. The order of profile
# definition items determines the order in which the profiles or
# specifications are tested.
#
# Each profile definition item is a dictionary with the following items.
# Unless otherwise stated, the items are required to be specified:
# * registered_org: Registered organization of the profile or specification
#   (as a string, e.g. 'SNIA').
# * registered_name: Registered name of the profile or specification.
# * type: Type of the profile or specification, as follows:
#   - specification: Item is a specification (e.g. SNIA SMI-S).
#   - autonomous: Item is an autonomous profile (e.g. SNIA Array).
#   - component: Item is a component profile (e.g. SNIA FC Target Ports).
# * reference_direction: Scoping profile reference direction: 'dmtf' or 'snia',
#   or null to imply it from registered_org.
#   Optional, defaults to null.
# * central_class: Class name of the central class of the profile.
#   Must be non-null for autonomous and component profiles.
# * scoping_class: Class name of the scoping class of the profile.
#   For component profiles, should be non-null, otherwise the implementation
#   must support the central class methodology.
#   Optional, defaults to null.
# * scoping_path: List of class names on the scoping path (from central to
#   scoping, excluding central and scoping classes).
#   For component profiles, should be non-null, otherwise the implementation
#   must support the central class methodology.
#   Optional, defaults to null.
# * doc: Informal reference to the standards document describing the profile.
#
# TODO #1554: Add support for representing profile versions.

  # Note: Special case: The 'SMI-S' profile is actually a registered
  #       specification, and thus does not have central class, scoping class,
  #       or scoping path. However, it is advertised like a profile via
  #       CIM_RegisteredProfile, which has CIM_ElementConformsToProfile to
  #       autonomous profiles that conform to the specific version of SMI-S.

  # Note: History: The SNIA 'Server' profile has been deprecated in
  #       SMI-S 1.7, listing the DMTF 'WBEM Server' profile as a replacement.
  #       There is an intention in the SMI-S community to change this again,
  #       allowing the SNIA 'Server' profile and the DMTF 'WBEM Server' profile
  #       to be implemented. However, as of the current SMI-S 1.8 Revision 3,
  #       the SNIA 'Server' profile is still listed as deprecated. Note that
  #       deprecated profiles must still be implemented in SMI-S.
  # Note: SMI-S change: In SMI-S 1.8, the Server profile is defined as
  #       autonomous, but its scoping class CIM_System is different from its
  #       central class CIM_ObjectManager. That violates the DMTF definition of
  #       autonomous, and requires treating the profile like a component
  #       profile for discovery purposes. Discussion with Mike Walker settled
  #       on resolving this by changing the scoping class in SMI-S to
  #       CIM_ObjectManager.
  #       See SMIS-180-Errata-SCR00004 for the corresponding change request.
  #       The definition below reflects that change already.

  #       * SMI-S 1.7 has removed the profile. The respective section
  #         states that the DMTF 'WBEM Server' profile should be implemented

  # Note: Special case: SMI-S 1.6 defines that 'Object Manager Adapter'

# Note: History on all SNIA indications related profiles:
#       * The SNIA 'Indication' profile already existed in SMI.S 1.2 as stable.
#       * SMI-S 1.5 (or 1.4?) introduced a SNIA 'Experimental Indication'
#         profile as experimental, that specializes the SNIA 'Indication'
#         profile.
#       * SMI-S 1.6 introduced a SNIA 'Indications' profile as experimental,
#         that specializes the DMTF 'Indications' profile (DSP1054), and also
#         deprecated the two earlier profiles, with the new SNIA 'Indications'
#         profile as a replacement.
#       * In SMI-S 1.7, the two earlier profiles were removed from the
#         standard (the chapter about the SNIA 'Indication' profile still
#         exists and contains a reference to the respective chapter in
#         SMI-S 1.6). Also, the SNIA 'Indications' profile was removed again
#         (the respective chapter still exists and contains a reference to the
#         DMTF 'Indications' profile).
# Note: The profile definitions below do not include the SNIA 'Experimental
#       Indication' profile and the SNIA 'Indications' profile because they
#       were removed while still being experimental.

  # Note: SMI-S change: The 'File Storage' profile is not a package,
  #       despite the fact that it only defines an association. The profile
  #       definition in SMI-S 1.8 does not define central class or scoping
  #       class. However, for discovery as a component profile, it needs to
  #       define central class, scoping class, and scoping path. Discussion
  #       with Mike Walker settled on the definitions below. Note that the
  #       central class CIM_LogicalDisk is not part of this profile, but pywbem
  #       does not require that the central class is in the profile.
  #       See SMIS-180-Errata-SCR00003 for the corresponding change request.
