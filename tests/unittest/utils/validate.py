"""
Utility function for validation of XML strings against the CIM-XML DTD.

The CIM-XML DTD is defined in DSP0201 as a text standard that shows the DTD
in the text. DSP0203 is the complete DTD, but is provided only for convenience.
In case of differences, DSP0201 overrules DSP0203.

Note: The CIM_DTD_V22.dtd file used for DTD checking by pywbem for some time
      is a preliminary version that contained a few elements that were never
      released as a DMTF standard:
        TABLE, TABLEROW, TABLEROW.DECLARATION, TABLECELL.DECLARATION,
        TABLECELL.REFERENCE, RESPONSEDESTINATION, SIMPLEREQACK.

Note: Changes in DSP0203 2.3.1, compared to 2.2.0 (final):
      - SIMPLERSP: Removed child SIMPLEREQACK, to fix a an incompletely removed
        left-over from the preliminary version of 2.2.
      - RETURNVALUE: Made its child elements optional, in support of void
        CIM methods.
      - IMETHODRESPONSE: Added PARAMVALUE*, in support of pull operations. Note
        this was inconsistent and IPARAMVALUE should have been used.
      - PARAMVALUE: Added choices for children CLASSNAME, CLASS, INSTANCE,
        VALUE.NAMEDINSTANCE, in support of pull operations (became necessary
        as a result of using PARAMVALUE in IMETHODRESPONSE).
      - ENUMERATIONCONTEXT: Added this element in support of pull operations.

Note: Changes in DSP0203 2.4.0, compared to 2.3.1:
      - KEYVALUE: Its TYPE attribute is now required. (incompatible!)
      - SIMPLEREQ: Added optional CORRELATOR* children, in support of operation
        correlation.
      - CORRELATOR: Added this element in support of operation correlation.
      - PARAMVALUE: Added choice for children INSTANCENAME* in support of
        pull operations (became necessary as a result of using PARAMVALUE in
        IMETHODRESPONSE).
      - IRETURNVALUE: Added choice for children VALUE.INSTANCEWITHPATH* in
        support of pull operations.
      - ENUMERATIONCONTEXT: Removed this element again, because representation
        of enumeration context value in pull operations was changed to string
        in DSP0200.
      - EXPPARAMVALUE: Removed incorrect children VALUE, METHODRESPONSE,
        IMETHODRESPONSE, because they were not needed.
