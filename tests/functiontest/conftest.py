"""
A conftest.py file is a Python module that is recognized by pytest via its name
and that contains directory-specific pytest hook implementations. See
https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html#local-conftest-plugins.

This particular conftest.py module is responsible for treating the .yaml
files in this directory (nicknamed "testclient .yaml files" in some of the
documentation) as test cases and for running them.

A testclient .yaml file in this directory defines one or more test cases. Each
test case invokes a single WBEM operation, and the test case specifies the
WBEM operation along with its input parameters, the expected CIM-XML request,
a mocked CIM-XML response, and the expected results of the operation. The
test cases are run against a WBEMConnection object (i.e. not a
FakedWBEMConnection object), whereby its http level transport is mocked using
the Python 'requests_mock' package. This allows asserting the HTTP request and
injecting an HTTP response.

When running such a test case, the WBEMConnection method for the operation that
is specified in the test case will be invoked with the specified input
parameters. Pywbem will process the operation and will at some point try to
send the HTTP request. The HTTP request will be captured by requests_mock and
the test logic will be called back and will assert that the captured HTTP
request matches the expected HTTP request that is specified in the test case.
The HTTP response specified in the test case is then injected by requests_mock
and pywbem will process the HTTP response, and returns from the WBEMConnection
method with the operation results. The test case logic finally asserts that the
returned operation results match the expected results that are specified in the
test case.

The test case syntax allows specifying error cases and success cases.

This allows testing the entire pywbem client layer (at least of its
WBEMConnection class), with the exception of the lowest layers of the HTTP
transport logic in the _cim_http.py module of pywbem. This nearly holistic
test approach for the client inspired the term "testclient .yaml files".

The following is a description of a single test case in the testclient .yaml
files in YAML syntax, using curly braces to indicate syntax elements, and
using comment lines for informally stated conditions::

    - name: {tc_name}
      description: {tc_desc}
      ignore_test: true/false  # default: false
      ignore_python_version: 2/3/null  # default: null
      ignore_debug_comparison: true/false  # default: false
      pywbem_request:
        {WBEMConnection_ctor_args}
        operation:
          pywbem_method: {op_method_name}
          {op_method_args}
      pywbem_response:
# if operation is a non-pull operation and expected to succeed:
        result: {op_method_return}
# if operation is an open/pull operation and expected to succeed:
        pullresult: {pull_op_method_return}
# if operation is expected to fail with CIM status code (CIMError exception):
        cim_status: {op_cim_status}
        error_istances: {error_instances}  # optional
# if operation is expected to fail with an arbitrary exception:
        exception: {op_exc_type}
# optional:
        request_len: {request_len}
# optional:
        reply_len: {reply_len}
      http_request:
        verb: {http_method}
        url: {http_url}
        headers:
          {http_request_headers}
        data: {http_request_body}
      http_response:
# if the mocked HTTP layer should succeed:
        status: {http_status}
        headers:
          {http_response_headers}
        data: {http_response_body}
# if the mocked HTTP layer should fail:
        exception: {http_exc_type}

Syntax elements:

* {tc_name}: String that identfies the test case, unique within the .yaml file.
* {tc_desc}: One-line description of the test case.
* {WBEMConnection_ctor_args}: Dict items representing the WBEMConnection
  ctor arguments as kwargs. The argument values are represented as described in
  the obj() function.
* {op_method_name}: String that is the name of the WBEMConnection method
  for the WBEM operation to be invoked by the test case.
* {op_method_args}: Dict items representing the arguments for calling the
  WBEM operation method as kwargs. The argument values are represented as
  described in the obj() function. The following item keys are supported:
  - url: url argument
  - creds: creds argument
  - namespace: default_namespace argument
  - timeout: timeout argument
  - stats-enabled: stats_enabled argument
  - debug: debug attribute
* {op_exc_type}: String that is the Python class name of the expected exception
  raised by the operation method.
* {op_cim_status}: Numeric CIM status code. This implies an expected exception
  class CIMError.
* {error_instances}: List of CIM instances that should be returned as
  instances in an error response.
* {request_len}: Numeric length of HTTP request body
* {reply_len}: Numeric length of HTTP response body
* {op_method_return}: Expected return value of the operation method,
  represented as described in the obj() function.
* {pull_op_method_return}: Expected return value of the open or pull operation
  method, represented as described in the obj() function.
* {http_method}: String with the expected name of the HTTP method that is used
  in the generated HTTP request, in upper case (e.g. POST).
* {http_url}: String with the expected URL in the generated HTTP request.
* {http_request_headers}: Dict items for the expected HTTP header fields in the
  request. The request may contain more than those.
* {http_request_body}: String with the expected body (CIM-XML) of the generated
  HTTP request. The string can be split over
* {http_status}: HTTP status to be used for the injected HTTP response (e.g.
  200).
* {http_response_headers}: Dict items with the HTTP header fields to be used
  for the injected HTTP response. Some header fields are auto-generated without
  being specified in the test case (see the code for details).
* {http_response_body}: String with the body (CIM-XML) to be used for the
  injected HTTP response.
* {http_exc_type}: String that is the Python class name of the exception
  to be raised by the mocked HTTP transport layer, which is then to be handled
  by the pywbem code.

    Background for having this function:

    For testing purposes, the response body should support characters that are
    illegal from as many different perspectives as possible. At this point, the
    response body may specify anything that is legal in a Python unicode
    string. Up to now, Python unicode strings allow for unpaired surrogates
    (i.e. a surrogate code point followed by a non-surrogate code point), or
    swapped surrogates (i.e. a high surrogate code point followed by a low
    surrogate code point). However, httpretty converts a body presented as a
    Python unicode string into a byte string using str.encode() which fails in
    Python 3 in case of such surrogate issues (it tolerates that in Python 2).
    In order to allow such invalid surrogates in responses to be tested, this
    function converts the unicode body string to a UTF-8 byte string in a way
    that tolerates surrogate issues in both Python 2 and Python 3.
