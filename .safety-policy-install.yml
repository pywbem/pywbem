#
# Generally package vulnerabilites listed in the ignore-vulnerabilities
# list below are there because:
# 1. There is no release that resolves the vulnerability.  In this case, there
#    should also be an expire entry to remind the pywbem team to recheck
# 2. The required version of a package to resolve the issue is not available
#    for all of the python version supported by pywbem. In that case, the
#    vulnerability will remain ignored until such time as the versions of
#    python that cannot support the required version of the package are no
#    longer supported by pywbem.

# Configuration for the 'safety check' command
security:

    # Ignore certain severities.
    # A number between 0 and 10, with the following significant values:
    # - 9: ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL severity
    # - 7: ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL & HIGH severity
    # - 4: ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL, HIGH & MEDIUM severity
    ignore-cvss-severity-below: 0

    # Ignore unknown severities.
    # Should be set to False.
    ignore-cvss-unknown-severity: False

    # Ignore unpinned requirements
    # Default is true. "Unpinned" in this case means anything else but "==".
    # Since we are checking against the minimum-constraints file, this check
    # is enabled (false).
