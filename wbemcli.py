    WBEM operation: IterEnumerateInstances

    A generator function to retrieve instances from a WBEM Server.
    This method frees the user of choices between the multiple
    EnumerateInstances/OpenEnumerateInstance methods and reduces
    the enumeration to a pythonic iterator idiom.

    This method performs either the
    :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances` and
    :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`
    operations (pull operations) or the
    :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstances` operation
    (traditional operation) if the WBEM server does not support the
    pull operations. It is an alternative to using these operations
    directly, that automatically uses the pull operations if supported.

    Parameters:

      cn (string or CIMClassName):
          Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).

          If specified as a `CIMClassName` object, its `host` attribute will be
          ignored.

      ns (string):
          Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

          If `None`, defaults to the namespace of the `cn` parameter if
          specified as a `CIMClassName`, or to the default namespace of the
          connection.

      lo (bool):
          LocalOnly flag: Exclude inherited properties.

          Deprecated: Server impls for True vary; Set to False.

          `None` will cause the server default of `True` to be used.

      di (bool):
          DeepInheritance flag: Include properties added by subclasses.

          `None` will cause the server default of `True` to be used.

      iq (bool):
          IncludeQualifiers flag: Include qualifiers.

          Deprecated: Instance qualifiers have been deprecated in CIM.

          `None` will cause the server default of `False` to be used.

      ico (bool):
          IncludeClassOrigin flag: Include class origin info for props.

          Deprecated: Server may treat as False.

          `None` will cause the server default of `False` to be used.

      pl (iterable of string):
          PropertyList: Names of properties to be included (if not otherwise
          excluded). If `None`, all properties will be included.

      fl (string):
          Filter query language to be used for the filter defined in the `fi`
          parameter.

          `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

      fq (string):
          Filter to apply to objects to be returned. Based on filter query
          language defined by `fl` parameter.

          `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

      ot (integer):
          Operation timeout in seconds. This is the minimum time the server
          must keep the enumerate session open between requests in the
          enumeration sequence.

          A value of 0 indicates that the server should never time out.

          The server may reject the proposed value.

          `None` will cause the server to use its default timeout.

      coe (bool):
          Continue on error flag.

          `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

      moc (integer):
          Maximum number of objects to return for this operation. This
          must be a non-zero positive integer.

          `None` is not allowed as a positive integer is required for all
          of the Pull... requests.

    Returns:

        A Python :term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
        by iterating through the object. Instances that are retrieved
        include the host and namespace component of the instance path.

    This method performs either the

    operations (pull operations) or the

    Parameters:

      op (CIMInstanceName):
          Source instance path.

      ac (string):
          AssociationClass filter: Include only traversals across this

          (result) class.

          `None` means this filter is not applied.

          name) in associated (=result) objects.

          `None` means this filter is not applied.

      iq (bool):
          IncludeQualifiers flag: Include qualifiers.

          Deprecated: Instance qualifiers have been deprecated in CIM.

          `None` will cause the server default of `False` to be used.

      ico (bool):
          IncludeClassOrigin flag: Include class origin info for props.

          Deprecated:  Server impls. vary; Server may treat as False.

          `None` will cause the server default of `False` to be used.

      pl (iterable of string):
          PropertyList: Names of properties to be included (if not otherwise
          excluded). If `None`, all properties will be included.

      fl (string):
          Filter query language to be used for the filter defined in the `fi`
          parameter.

          `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

      fq (string):
          Filter to apply to objects to be returned. Based on filter query
          language defined by `fl` parameter.

          `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

      ot (integer):
          Operation timeout in seconds. This is the minimum time the server
          must keep the enumerate session open between the requests of
          the enumeration sequence.

          A value of 0 indicates that the server should never time out.

          The server may reject the proposed value.

          `None` will cause the server to use its default timeout.

      coe (bool):
          Continue on error flag.

          `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

      moc (integer):
          Maximum number of objects to return for this operation. This
          must be a non-zero positive integer.

          `None` is not allowed as a positive integer is required for all
          of the Pull... requests.

    Returns:

          A Python:term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object.
