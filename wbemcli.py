    Parameters:

      cn (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
          Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).

          If specified as a `CIMClassName` object, its `host` attribute will be

      ns (:term:`string`):
          Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

          If `None`, defaults to the namespace of the `cn` parameter if
          specified as a `CIMClassName`, or to the default namespace of the
          connection.

      lo (:class:`py:bool`):
          LocalOnly flag: Exclude inherited properties.

          `None` will cause the server default of `True` to be used.

          Deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`: WBEM server implementations for `True`
          may vary; this parameter should be set to `False` by the caller.

      di (:class:`py:bool`):
          DeepInheritance flag: Include properties added by subclasses.

          If `None`, this parameter will not be sent to the server, and the
          server default of `True` will be used.

      iq (:class:`py:bool`):
          IncludeQualifiers flag: Include qualifiers.

          `None` will cause the server default of `False` to be used.

          Deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`: Clients cannot rely on qualifiers to
          be returned in this operation.

      ico (:class:`py:bool`):
          IncludeClassOrigin flag: Include class origin information for the
          properties in the retrieved instances.

          `None` will cause the server default of `False` to be used.

          Deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`: WBEM servers may either implement this

Debugging support:
  pdb('<stmt>')    Enter PDB debugger to execute <stmt>

Printing support:
  pp(<obj>)        pprint function, good for dicts
  repr(<obj>)      Operation result objects have repr() for debugging
  print(<obj>.tomof())
                   Operation result objects often have a tomof()
                   producing a MOF string
  print(<obj>.tocimxmlstr())
                   Operation result objects have a tocimxmlstr()

Help:
  help(<op>)       Help for global operation functions, e.g. help(gi)
  help(conn.<OpName>)
                   Help for operation methods on WBEMConnection, e.g.
                   help(conn.GetInstance).
