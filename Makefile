# Makefile for pybem repository of pywbem project
#
# Supported OS platforms for this Makefile:
#     Linux (any distro)
#     OS-X
#     Windows with UNIX-like env such as CygWin (with a UNIX-like shell and
#       Python in the UNIX-like env)
#     native Windows (with the native Windows command processor and Python in
#       Windows)
#
# Prerequisites for running this Makefile:
#   These commands are used on all supported OS platforms. On native Windows,
#   they may be provided by UNIX-like environments such as CygWin:
#     make (GNU make)
#     python (This Makefile uses the active Python environment, virtual Python
#       environments are supported)
#     pip (in the active Python environment)
#     twine (in the active Python environment)
#   These additional commands are used on Linux, OS-X and on Windows with
#   UNIX-like environments:
#     uname
#     rm, find, xargs, cp
#     The commands listed in pywbem_os_setup.sh
#   These additional commands are used on native Windows:
#     del, copy, rmdir
#     The commands listed in pywbem_os_setup.bat

# Determine OS platform make runs on.
#
# The PLATFORM variable is set to one of:
# * Windows_native: Windows native environment (the Windows command processor
#   is used as shell and its internal commands are used, such as "del").
# * Windows_UNIX: A UNIX-like envieonment on Windows (the UNIX shell and its
#   internal commands are used, such as "rm").
# * Linux: Some Linux distribution
# * Darwin: OS-X / macOS
#
# This in turn determines the type of shell that is used by make when invoking
# commands, and the set of internal shell commands that is assumed to be
# available (e.g. "del" for the Windows native command processor and "rm" for
# a UNIX-like shell). Note that GNU make always uses the value of the SHELL
# make variable to invoke the shell for its commands, but it does not always
# read that variable from the environment. In fact, the approach GNU make uses
# to set the SHELL make variable is very special, see
# https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Choosing-the-Shell.html.
# On native Windows this seems to be implemented differently than described:
# SHELL is not set to COMSPEC, so we do that here. When COMSPEC includes a
# path, it specifies it using backslashes. GNU make internally changes any
# backslashes in SHELL to forward slashes, so $(SHELL) cannot be used on
# native Windows to invoke the shell. Using $(shell ...) works.
#
# Note: Native Windows and CygWin are hard to distinguish: The native Windows
# envvars are set in CygWin as well. COMSPEC (or ComSpec) is set on both
# platforms. Using "uname" will display CYGWIN_NT-.. on both platforms. If the
# CygWin make is used on native Windows, most of the CygWin behavior is visible
# in context of that make (e.g. a SHELL variable is set, PATH gets converted to
# UNIX syntax, execution of batch files requires execute permission, etc.).
