Test: The files that were in the source archive were not sufficient to build,
check and test the project using "make". To enable using "make", the following
files have been added to the source distribution archive:

  * done/ directory
  * tools/ directory
  * config files for tools (.flake8, etc)
  * requirements and constraints files
  * Makefile
  * tox.ini

The new set of files in the source distribution archive now allows to build,
check and test the project using "make" from only that archive.
