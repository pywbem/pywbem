Aligned the names of two :class:`pywbem.WBEMListener` methods for more
consistency. These methods were added in pywbem version 1.8.0, and we consider
this a fix:

  * Renamed ``ind_delivery_queue_empty()`` to :meth:`pywbem.WBEMListener.ind_queue_empty`.
  * Renamed ``queue_size()`` to :meth:`pywbem.WBEMListener.ind_queue_size`.
