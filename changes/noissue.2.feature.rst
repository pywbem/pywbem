Development: The pywbem version during development now uses an automatically
calculated dev number and the git commit hash, e.g. '1.8.0a1.dev9+gad875911'.
Note that the pywbem version numbers for packages released to Pypi is
unchanged: 'M.N.U'.
Updated the release description in DEVELOP.md to no longer edit the version
file, but to set tags.
