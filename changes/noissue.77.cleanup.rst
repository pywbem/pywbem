The stoppable thread functionality was moved from 'CallbackThread' into a new
'StoppableThread' class, and the exception handling functionality was moved
from 'ServerThread' into a new 'ExceptionHandlingThread' class, in order to
be able to use both in a derived class in the future.
The 'ServerThread' class now inherits from 'ExceptionHandlingThread', and
the 'CallbackThread' class now inherits from 'StoppableThread', and thus
they have no change in functionality.
