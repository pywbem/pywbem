# Pip constraints file for install dependencies.
#
# This file specifies constraints that match the minimum versions specified in
# the requirement file for package installation (requirements.txt). They are
# used for example when setting up test environments with the minimum versions
# of any dependent packages. This includes base dependencies
# (pip+setuptools+wheel) that are needed for setting up a minimum version
# environment, but are not specified in requirements.txt.


# Base dependencies (must be consistent with base-requirements.txt)
