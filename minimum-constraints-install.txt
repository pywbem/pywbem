# Pip constraints file for install dependencies.
#
# This file specifies constraints that match the minimum versions specified in
# the requirement file for package installation (requirements.txt). They are
# used for example when setting up test environments with the minimum versions
# of any dependent packages. This includes base dependencies
# (pip+setuptools+wheel) that are needed for setting up a minimum version
# environment, but are not specified in requirements.txt.


# Base dependencies (must be consistent with base-requirements.txt)

pip==25.2
setuptools==78.1.1
setuptools-scm==9.2.0
wheel==0.41.3


# Direct dependencies for install (must be consistent with requirements.txt)

ply==3.10
PyYAML==6.0.2
# requests version 2.32.0 required by safety issue 71064 (2.32.0, 2.32.1 yanked)
requests==2.32.4
yamlloader==0.5.5

# typing-extensions
typing-extensions==4.14.1


# Indirect dependencies for install that are needed for some reason (must be consistent with requirements.txt)

urllib3==2.5.0
certifi==2024.07.04

# requests 2.31 requires idna>=2.5,<4
# anyio 3.1.0 depends on idna>=2.8
# idna>3 requires using requests >=2.26.0
idna==3.7


# All other indirect dependencies for install that are not in requirements.txt

# requests>=2.26.0 uses charset-normalizer instead of chardet; both are not used by any other package
chardet==3.0.2; python_version <= '3.9'
charset-normalizer==2.0.0; python_version >= '3.10'

# funcsigs; is covered in direct deps for develop, from mock
