# Pip constraints file for install dependencies.
#
# This file specifies constraints that match the minimum versions specified in
# the requirement file for package installation (requirements.txt). They are
# used for example when setting up test environments with the minimum versions
# of any dependent packages. This includes base dependencies
# (pip+setuptools+wheel) that are needed for setting up a minimum version
# environment, but are not specified in requirements.txt.


# Base dependencies (must be consistent with base-requirements.txt)

pip==23.3
setuptools==66.1.0
setuptools-scm==8.0
wheel==0.38.1


# Direct dependencies for install (must be consistent with requirements.txt)

ply==3.10
PyYAML==5.3.1
requests==2.31.0
yamlloader==0.5.5

# typing-extensions
# nocaselist 2.x requires typing-extensions>=3.10 on Python<=3.9
# rich 12.0.0 requires Python>=3.6 and typing-extensions>=3.7.4,<5.0 on Python<=3.7
# rich 12.1.0 requires Python>=3.6 and typing-extensions>=4.0.0,<5.0 on Python<=3.8
# rich 13.x.x requires Python>=3.7 and typing-extensions>=4.0.0,<5.0 on Python<=3.8
typing-extensions==4.0.0; python_version <= '3.9'

# Indirect dependencies for install that are needed for some reason (must be consistent with requirements.txt)

urllib3==1.26.18

# requests 2.31 requires idna>=2.5,<4
# anyio 3.1.0 depends on idna>=2.8

# All other indirect dependencies for install that are not in requirements.txt

# requests>=2.26.0 uses charset-normalizer instead of chardet; both are not used by any other package
chardet==3.0.2; python_version <= '3.9'
charset-normalizer==2.0.0; python_version >= '3.10'

# funcsigs; is covered in direct deps for develop, from mock
