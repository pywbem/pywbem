Pywbem is a WBEM client, written in pure Python. It supports Python 2 and
Python 3.
        
A WBEM client allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using the CIM
operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
DSP0200 and DSP0201. The CIM/WBEM infrastructure is used for a wide variety of
systems management tasks supported by systems running WBEM servers.
See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for more information about WBEM.
