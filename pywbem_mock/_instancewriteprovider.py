"""
The :class:`~pywbem_mock.InstanceWriteProvider` class provides the default
implementations of the ``CreateInstance``, ``ModifyInstance`` and
``DeleteInstance`` provider methods by means of
:meth:`~pywbem_mock.InstanceWriteProvider.CreateInstance`,
:meth:`~pywbem_mock.InstanceWriteProvider.ModifyInstance`, and
:meth:`~pywbem_mock.InstanceWriteProvider.DeleteInstance`.

A user-defined instance write provider may implement some or all of these
provider methods. The method descriptions linked above provide a detailed
definition of the input parameters, return values, and required behavior.

The following is a simple example of a user-defined instance write provider
that serves the 'CIM_Foo' and 'CIM_FooFoo' classes and implements
``CreateInstance`` for the purpose of setting a value for the 'InstanceID' key
property:

.. code-block:: python

    import uuid
    from pywbem_mock import InstanceWriteProvider

    class MyInstanceProvider(InstanceWriteProvider):

        # CIM classes served by this provider
        provider_classnames = ['CIM_Foo', 'CIM_FooFoo']

        def CreateInstance(self, namespace, new_instance):
            new_instance.properties["InstanceID"] = \\
                "{}.{}".format(new_instance.classname, uuid.uuid4())
            return super(MyInstanceProvider, self).CreateInstance(
                namespace, new_instance)

Because the provider in this example does not implement the
``ModifyInstance`` and ``DeleteInstance`` methods, these operations will
use their default implementations from
:class:`~pywbem_mock.InstanceWriteProvider`.

NOTE: Bidirectional association support was added in pywbem version 1.5.
originally the association was visible only in the target namespace for the
CreateInstance so Associations and References only handled reference properties
in that namespace.

This instance provider handles association instances that cross namespaces.
Since the association must be available in all of the namespaces defined by the
reference properties of a new instance (References and Associations requests
can be issued using any of the reference properties in the instance), the
CreateInstance creates the association instance in each namespace defined in a
reference property of the instance (it creates shadow instances of the
association in each namespace defined by a reference property in the
association), ModifyInstance modifies the instance and shadow instances, and
DeleteInstance deletes the instance and shadow instances. References and
Association requests can be executed on instances defined in any namespace
where the association is defined.

These shadow instances are visible in each affected namespaces with the
GetInstance and EnumerateInstance requests.

This is transparent. The association instance is visible in each of the
affected namespaces and References and Associations requests can be issued
using any of the reference properties and the operation source instance.

The provider in this example does not need to implement an ``__init__()``
method, because no additional init parameters are needed.

        Default provider method for

        Create a new CIM instance in the CIM repository of the mock WBEM server.

        Validation already performed by the provider dispatcher that calls
        this provider method:

        - The provider method is called only for the registered class and
          namespace (only applies to user-defined providers).

        - The Python types of all input parameters to this provider method are
          as specified below.

        - The namespace exists in the CIM repository.

        - The creation class of the new instance exists in the namespace
          in the CIM repository.

        - All properties specified in the new instance are exposed (i.e.
          defined and inherited with any overrides resolved) by the creation
          class in the CIM repository, and have the same type-related
          attributes (i.e. type, is_array, embedded_object).

        - The creation class of the new instance must not be an abstract class.

        Validation that should be performed by this provider method:

        - new_instance does not specify any properties that are not
          allowed to be initialized by the client, depending on the model
          implemented by the provider.

        - new_instance specifies all key properties needed by the
          provider, depending on the model implemented by the provider.
          The CIM repository will reject any new instance that does not have
          all key properties specified.

        - The new instance (i.e. an instance with the new instance path) does
          not exist in the CIM repository.
          This validation needs to be done by the provider because the
          determination of the key properties for the new instance path may
          depend on the model implemented by the provider.
          The CIM repository will reject the creation of instances that already
          exist, so this check can be delegated to the repository once the
          new instance path has been determined.

        - If new_instance is an association, the reference properties must
          define existing end-point paths to instances or have value
          None.

        Parameters:

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            The name of the CIM namespace in which the CIM instance is to be
            created, in any lexical case, and with leading and trailing slash
            characters removed.

          new_instance (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
            A representation of the CIM instance to be created.

            This object is a deep copy of the original client parameter, and may
            be modified by the provider as needed, before storing it in the
            CIM repository.

            The property names in this object have been adjusted to match the
            lexical case of the property definitions in the creation class
            of the instance in the CIM repository.

            The `classname` attribute of this object will specify the
            creation class for the new instance, in any lexical case.

            The `properties` attribute of this object will specify the
            initial property values for the new CIM instance, with property
            names in any lexical case. Key properties may or may not be
            included.

            The `path` attribute of this object will be `None`.

            The `qualifiers` attribute of this object, if non-empty, should
            be ignored by the provider, because instance-level qualifiers have
            been deprecated in CIM.

        Returns:

            :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`: Instance path of the new CIM
            instance.

        Raises:

        Default provider method for

        Modify an existing CIM instance in the CIM repository of the mock WBEM
        server.

        NOTE: This method specifies the namespace in modified_instance.path
        rather than as a separate input parameter.

        The modification of the instance in the CIM repository that is performed
        by the provider should be limited to property value changes (including
        addition of properties if not yet set on the instance), because
        instance-level qualifiers have been deprecated in CIM.

        The set of properties that are to be modified in the CIM instance has
        already been determined by the caller so that the modified_instance
        parameter specifies exactly the set of properties to be modified.
        Therefore, this provider method does not have a property list
        parameter.

        Validation already performed by the provider dispatcher that calls
        this provider method:

        - The provider method is called only for the registered class and
          namespace (only applies to user-defined providers).

        - The Python types of all input parameters to this provider method are
          as specified below.

        - The classnames in modified_instance are consistent between
          instance and instance path.

        - The namespace exists in the CIM repository.

        - The creation class of the instance to be modified exists in the
          namespace of the CIM repository.

        - The instance to be modified exists in the namespace of the CIM
          repository.

        - All properties in modified_instance that are to be modified are
          exposed (i.e. defined and inherited with any overrides resolved) by
          the creation class in the CIM repository, and have the same
          type-related attributes (i.e. type, is_array, embedded_object).

        - No key properties are requested to change their values.

        - If there was a property list for the request, only properties defined
          in that property list are included in the modified_instance.

        Validation that should be performed by this provider method:

        - modified_instance does not specify any changed values for
          properties that are not allowed to be changed by the client,
          depending on the model implemented by the provider.

        Validation executed for this default provider:

        - Validate that any reference properties to be modified that are not
          keys define an association end point instance that currently exists
          and that the en-point instances exist.

        - If the association crosses namespaces, validate that the association
          already exists in all namespaces defined in the reference properties.

        Parameters:

          modified_instance (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
            A representation of the modified CIM instance, also indicating its
            instance path, with exactly the set of properties to be modified.

            be modified by the provider as needed, before storing it in the
            CIM repository.

            The `path` attribute of this object will be set and is the
            instance path of the instance to be modified in the CIM repository.
            Its `namespace`, `classname` and `keybindings` attributes
            will be set. The names will be in any lexical case.

            The `classname` attribute of this object will specify the creation
            class of the instance to be modified, in any lexical case.

            The `properties` attribute of this object will specify exactly the
            set of properties that are to be updated, taking into account the
            original ModifiedInstance and PropertyList input parameters of the
            ModifyInstance() client call.
            The lexical case of the property names has been adjusted to match
            the lexical cae of the property definitions in the creation class
            in the CIM repository.

            The `qualifiers` attribute of this object, if non-empty, should
