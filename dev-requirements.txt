# Issue #2674: lazy-object-proxy fails installing on macos/py35/minimum, because it uses

#   This issue is circumvented by not installing pylint/astroid on py35.

#   this circumvention can be removed again.

# The tornado package is used by ipykernel which is used by jupyter.

#   RHEL 7.4. This can be checked with:
#     python -c "import ssl; ssl.SSLContext; ssl.create_default_context; ssl.match_hostname"
