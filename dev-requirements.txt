# Additional pip requirements file for pywbem develop.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.

# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are also the
# versions defined in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Direct dependencies:


# Unit test (imports into testcases):
packaging>=17.0
funcsigs>=1.0.2; python_version < '3.3'
# pytest 5.0.0 has removed support for Python < 3.5
# pytest 4.3.1 solves an issue on Python 3 with minimum package levels
pytest>=4.3.1,<5.0.0; python_version < '3.5'
pytest>=4.3.1; python_version >= '3.5'
testfixtures>=6.9.0
# lxml 4.4.0 removed Python 3.4 support.
# lxml 4.4.1 added Python 3.8 support. However, while providing binary wheel
#   files, it did not register Python 3.8 as a supported version in the
#   package metadata on Pypi. A fix for that is expected for the next lxml
#   version after 4.4.2 (See https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1854465
#   and https://github.com/lxml/lxml/pull/291). Before that, pip 19.3.1
#   is required to properly deal with this inconsistency (see issue #1980).

# Jupyter Notebook (no imports, invoked via jupyter script):
# The jupyter package is not installed on Python 3.4 on Windows, because its
# (indirectly) dependent pywin32 package is not available on Pypi for
# Python 3.4.
jupyter>=1.0.0; python_version != '3.4' or sys_platform != 'win32'

# Pywin32 is used (at least?) by jupyter.
# Pywin32 version 226 needs to be excluded, see issue #1946.
# Pywin32 version 222 is inconsistent in its 32-bit/64-bit support on py37
# Pywin32 version 225+ provides wheel files for py38, but does not advertise
# py38 on Pypi. That causes pywin32==225 to fail but pywin32>=225 to work.

# The tornado package is used by ipykernel which is used by jupyter.
# Tornado 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 rejects installation if the Python ssl module
# does not have certain symbols required by Tornado. This issue exists for
# example with Python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu 14.04, but not with Python 2.7.5 on
# RHEL 7.4. This can be checked with:
#   python -c "import ssl; ssl.SSLContext; ssl.create_default_context; ssl.match_hostname"
# Other projects have the same issue:
#   https://github.com/floydhub/dl-docker/issues/84
# The following is a circumvention of this issue that nails the tornado
# version to below 5.0 on Python 2.
# TODO: Follow up on resolution of this issue.

# Performance profiling tools

# Pinning typed-ast to <1.4.0 for Python 3.4 because it started removing
# Python 3.4 support.
# Requiring typed-ast>=1.4.0 for Python 3.8 since it addresses compile errors
# with missing pgenheaders.h and duplicate definition of a struct.
typed-ast>=1.3.0,<1.4.0; python_version == '3.4'

# Indirect dependencies are no longer specified here, but for testing with a
