#   Not clear why this does not happen on ubuntu/windows with py35 or on py34.
#   See issue https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/issues/51.
#   This issue is circumvented by not installing pylint/astroid on py35.

#   this circumvention can be removed again.

# The tornado package is used by ipykernel which is used by jupyter.

#   RHEL 7.4. This can be checked with:
#     python -c "import ssl; ssl.SSLContext; ssl.create_default_context; ssl.match_hostname"
#   Other projects have the same issue:
#     https://github.com/floydhub/dl-docker/issues/84
#   There is no Tornado issue open for this and we do not expect it to be fixed
#   since it only appears on Python 2.
#   This issue has been circumvented by pinning the Tornado version to <5.0 on
#   Python 2.
