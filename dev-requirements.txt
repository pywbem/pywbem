# Additional pip requirements file for pywbem develop.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.

# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are also the
# versions defined in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Direct dependencies:

# Unit test (imports into testcases):
unittest2>=1.1.0
pytest>=3.0.7,<3.3.0; python_version == '2.6'
pytest>=3.3.0,!=3.9.2; python_version > '2.6'
# testfixtures 6.0.0 no longer supports py26 and fails on py26 with syntax error

lxml>=4.2.4; python_version > '2.6'
# Note: requests 2.19.1 has a security issue that is fixed in 2.20.0. However,
#       requests 2.20.0 has dropped support for Python 2.6.
requests>=2.19.1; python_version == '2.6'
requests>=2.20.1; python_version > '2.6'
decorator>=4.0.11
yamlordereddictloader>=0.4.0
funcsigs>=1.0.2

# Indirect dependencies that are needed due to version pinning
PyYAML==3.11; python_version == '2.6'  # yaml package, used by yamlordereddictloader
PyYAML>=3.13; python_version >= '2.7'  # yaml package, used by yamlordereddictloader

# Coverage reporting (no imports, invoked via coveralls script, only used on py27):
# Note: python-coveralls 2.9.1 has requirement coverage==4.0.3, and therefore
# must be stated before pytest-cov, whose 2.5.1 specifies requirement
# coverage>=3.7.1 and thus would get coverage 4.5 1 if processed first.
python-coveralls>=2.8.0; python_version == '2.7'

# Safety CI by pyup.io
safety>=1.8.4

# Unit test (no imports, invoked via py.test script):

# TODO: Remove the pinning of the pytest-cov version again once issue
#       https://github.com/z4r/python-coveralls/issues/66
#       is resolved.
#       Background: pytest-cov 2.6.0 has increased the version
#       requirement for the coverage package from >=3.7.1 to
#       >=4.4, which is in conflict with the version requirement
#       defined by the python-coveralls package for coverage==4.0.3.
pytest-cov>=2.4.0,<2.6

# Tox
tox>=2.0.0

# Sphinx (no imports, invoked via sphinx-build script, issues on py26):
Sphinx>=1.7.6,<2.0.0; python_version >= '2.7' and python_version < '3.5'  # BSD
Sphinx>=1.7.6,<2.0.0; python_version >= '3.5'  # BSD
# TODO: On py3.5+, Sphinx currently fails, see issue
#       https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6246. Therefore, Sphinx has
#       been pinned to below 2.0.0 also for py3.5+.
sphinx-git>=10.1.1; python_version >= '2.7'
GitPython>=2.1.1; python_version >= '2.7'

# PyLint (no imports, invoked via pylint script)
# Pylint requires astroid
# Pylint 1.x supports py2.7 and py3.4/5/6 but not py3.7+
# Pylint 2.x supports py3.4+
pylint>=1.6.4,<2.0.0; python_version == '2.7'
pylint>=2.2.2; python_version >= '3.4'
astroid>=1.4.9,<2.0.0; python_version == '2.7'
astroid>=2.1.0; python_version >= '3.4'

# Flake8 (no imports, invoked via flake8 script):
flake8>=2.6.2,<3.0.0; python_version == '2.6'
flake8>=3.2.1; python_version > '2.6'

# Twine (no imports, invoked via twine script):
twine>=1.8.1; python_version >= '2.7'

# Jupyter Notebook (no imports, invoked via jupyter script, some deps do not support py26):
jupyter>=1.0.0; python_version >= '2.7'

# The tornado package is used by ipykernel which is used by jupyter.
# Tornado 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 rejects installation if the Python ssl module
# does not have certain symbols required by Tornado. This issue exists for
# example with Python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu 14.04, but not with Python 2.7.5 on
# RHEL 7.4. This can be checked with:
#   python -c "import ssl; ssl.SSLContext; ssl.create_default_context; ssl.match_hostname"
# Other projects have the same issue:
#   https://github.com/floydhub/dl-docker/issues/84
# The following is a circumvention of this issue that nails the tornado
# version to below 5.0 on Python 2.
# TODO: Follow up on resolution of this issue.
tornado<5.0; python_version <= '2.7'

# Table output formatter used by the manual performance tests to display
# timing results
tabulate >= 0.8.3

# Performance profiling tools
pyinstrument >=3.0.1

# Indirect dependencies are no longer specified here, but for testing with a
# minimum version, they are listed in the minimum-constraints.txt file.

# TODO: docutils pinned to 0.14, see https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/issues/1788. Remove pinning once fixed.
docutils<=0.14
