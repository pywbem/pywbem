WBEM client library
===================

The WBEM client library API of pywbem supports issuing WBEM operations to a WBEM
server, using the CIM operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the
DMTF standards :term:`DSP0200` and :term:`DSP0201`.

A number of these topics apply also to the other APIs of the pywbem package.
