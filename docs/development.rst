.. _`Development`:

Development
===========

This section only needs to be read by developers of the pywbem package.
People that want to make a fix or develop some extension, and people that
want to test the project are also considered developers for the purpose of
this section.


.. _`Repository`:

Repository
----------

The repository for pywbem is on GitHub:

https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem


.. _`Setting up the development environment`:

Setting up the development environment
--------------------------------------

The development environment is pretty easy to set up.

Besides having a supported operating system with a supported Python version
(see :ref:`Supported environments`), it is recommended that you set up a
`virtual Python environment`_.

.. _virtual Python environment: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Then, with a virtual Python environment active, clone the Git repo of this
project and prepare the development environment with ``make develop``:

::

    $ git clone git@github.com:pywbem/pywbem.git
    $ cd pywbem
    $ make develop

This will install all prerequisites the package needs to run, as well as all
prerequisites that you need for development.

Generally, this project uses Make to do things in the currently active
Python environment. The command ``make help`` (or just ``make``) displays a
list of valid Make targets and a short description of what each target does.


.. _`Building the documentation`:

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The ReadTheDocs (RTD) site is used to publish the documentation for the
pywbem package at http://pywbem.readthedocs.io/

This page automatically gets updated whenever the ``master`` branch of the
Git repo for this package changes.

In order to build the documentation locally from the Git work directory, issue:

::

    $ make builddoc

The top-level document to open with a web browser will be
``build_doc/html/docs/index.html``.


.. _`Testing`:

Testing
-------

To run unit tests in the currently active Python environment, issue one of
these example variants of ``make test``:

::

    $ make test                                              # Run all unit tests
    $ PYTHONPATH=. py.test testsuite/test_cim_obj.py -s      # Run only this test source file
    $ PYTHONPATH=. py.test InitCIMInstanceName -s            # Run only this test class
    $ PYTHONPATH=. py.test -k InitCIMInstanceName or Bla -s  # py.test -k expressions are possible

Invoke ``py.test --help`` for details on the expression syntax of its ``-k``
option.

To run the unit tests and some more commands that verify the project is in good
shape in all supported Python environments, use Tox:

::

    $ tox                              # Run all tests on all supported Python versions
    $ tox -e py27                      # Run all tests on Python 2.7


.. _`Updating the DMTF MOF Test Schema`:

Updating the DMTF MOF Test Schema
---------------------------------

Pywbem uses DMTF CIM Schemas in its CI testing.  The schema used is stored in
the form received from the DMTF in the directory ``testsuite/schema`` and is
expanded and compiled in ``testsuite/test_mof_compiler.py`` as part of the
tests.

Since the DMTF regularly updates the schema, the pywbem project tries to stay
up-to-date with the current schema. At the same time, earlier schemas can be
used for testing also by changing the definitions for the dmtf schema to be
tested.

The schema used for testing can be modified by modifying the test file:

::

    testsuite/dmtf_mof_schema_def.py

Detailed information on this process is in ``testsuite/dmtf_mof_schema_def.py``


.. _`Contributing`:

Contributing
------------

Third party contributions to this project are welcome!

In order to contribute, create a `Git pull request`_, considering this:

.. _Git pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

* Test is required.
* Each commit should only contain one "logical" change.
* A "logical" change should be put into one commit, and not split over multiple
  commits.
* Large new features should be split into stages.
* The commit message should not only summarize what you have done, but explain
  why the change is useful.
* The commit message must follow the format explained below.

What comprises a "logical" change is subject to sound judgement. Sometimes, it
makes sense to produce a set of commits for a feature (even if not large).
For example, a first commit may introduce a (presumably) compatible API change
without exploitation of that feature. With only this commit applied, it should
be demonstrable that everything is still working as before. The next commit may
be the exploitation of the feature in other components.
