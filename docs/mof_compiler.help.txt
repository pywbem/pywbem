usage: mof_compiler [options] moffile ...

Compile MOF files, and update a namespace in a WBEM server with the result.

Positional arguments:
  moffile               Path name of the MOF file to be compiled.
                        Can be specified multiple times.

Server related options:
  Specify the WBEM server and namespace the MOF compiler works against, for
  looking up existing elements, and for applying the MOF compilation results
  to.

  -s url, --server url  Host name or URL of the WBEM server (required),
                        in this format:
                            [scheme://]host[:port]
                        - scheme: Defines the protocol to use:
                            - "https" for HTTPS protocol
                            - "http" for HTTP protocol
                          Default: "https".
                        - host: Defines host name as follows:
                             - short or fully qualified DNS hostname
                             - literal IPV4 address(dotted)
                             - literal IPV6 address (RFC 3986) with zone
                               identifier extensions(RFC 6874)
                               supporting "-" or %25 for the delimiter
                        - port: Defines the WBEM server port to be used.
                          Defaults:
                             - 5988, when using HTTP
                             - 5989, whenusing HTTPS
  -n namespace, --namespace namespace
                        Namespace in the WBEM server.
                        Default: root/cimv2

Connection security related options:
  Specify user name and password or certificates and keys

  -u user, --user user  User name for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: No user name.
  -p password, --password password
                        Password for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: Will be prompted for, if user name
                        specified.
  -nvc, --no-verify-cert
                        Client will not verify certificate returned by the
                        WBEM server (see cacerts). This bypasses the client-
                        side verification of the server identity, but allows
                        encrypted communication with a server for which the
                        client does not have certificates.
  --cacerts cacerts     File or directory containing certificates that will be
                        matched against a certificate received from the WBEM
                        server. Set the --no-verify-cert option to bypass
                        client verification of the WBEM server certificate.
                        Default: Searches for matching certificates in the
                        following system directories:
                        /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt
                        /etc/ssl/certs
                        /etc/ssl/certificates
  --certfile certfile   Client certificate file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. If option specified the client attempts
                        to execute mutual authentication.
                        Default: Simple authentication.
  --keyfile keyfile     Client private key file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. Not required if private key is part of the
                        certfile option. Not allowed if no certfile option.
                        Default: No client key file. Client private key should
                        then be part  of the certfile

Action related options:
  Specify actions against the WBEM server's namespace. Default:
  Create/update elements.

  -r, --remove          Removal mode: Remove elements (found in the MOF files)
                        from the WBEM server's namespace, instead of creating
                        or updating them
  -d, --dry-run         Dry-run mode: Don't actually modify the WBEM server's
                        namespace, just check MOF syntax. Connection to WBEM
                        server is still required to check qualifiers.

General options:
  -I dir, --include dir
                        Path name of a MOF include directory. Can be specified
                        multiple times.
  -v, --verbose         Print more messages while processing
  -V, --version         Display pywbem version and exit.
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit

Example: mof_compiler CIM_Schema_2.45.mof -s https://localhost -n root/cimv2
-u sheldon -p p42
