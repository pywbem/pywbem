usage: wbemcli [options] server

Provide an interactive shell for issuing operations against a WBEM server.

wbemcli executes the WBEMConnection as part of initialization so the user can
input requests as soon as the interactive shell is started.

Use h() in thenteractive shell for help for wbemcli methods and variables.

Deprecated: The wbemcli command has been deprecated in pywbem 0.15.0.
Version 1.0.0 of pywbem will remove the wbemcli command.
The recommended replacement is to use the pywbemcli command from the
pywbemtools package on Pypi.

Positional arguments:
  server                Host name or url of the WBEM server in this format:
                            [{scheme}://]{host}[:{port}]
                        - scheme: Defines the protocol to use;
                            - "https" for HTTPs protocol
                            - "http" for HTTP protocol.
                          Default: "https".
                        - host: Defines host name as follows:
                             - short or fully qualified DNS hostname,
                             - literal IPV4 address(dotted)
                             - literal IPV6 address (RFC 3986) with zone
                               identifier extensions(RFC 6874)
                               supporting "-" or %25 for the delimiter.
                        - port: Defines the WBEM server port to be used
                          Defaults:
                             - HTTP  - 5988
                             - HTTPS - 5989

Server related options:
  Specify the WBEM server namespace and timeout

  -n namespace, --namespace namespace
                        Default namespace in the WBEM server for operation
                        requests when namespace option not supplied with
                        operation request.
                        Default: root/cimv2
  -t timeout, --timeout timeout
                        Timeout of the completion of WBEM Server operation
                        in seconds(integer between 0 and 300).
                        Default: No timeout

Connection security related options:
  Specify user name and password or certificates and keys

  -u user, --user user  User name for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: No user name.
  -p password, --password password
                        Password for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: Will be prompted for, if user name
                        specified.
  -nvc, --no-verify-cert
                        Client will not verify certificate returned by the
                        WBEM server (see cacerts). This bypasses the client-
                        side verification of the server identity, but allows
                        encrypted communication with a server for which the
                        client does not have certificates.
  --cacerts cacerts     File or directory containing certificates that will be
                        matched against a certificate received from the WBEM
                        server. Set the --no-verify-cert option to bypass
                        client verification of the WBEM server certificate.
                        Default: Searches for matching certificates in the
                        following system directories:
                        /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt
                        /etc/ssl/certs
                        /etc/ssl/certificates
  --certfile certfile   Client certificate file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. If option specified the client attempts
                        to execute mutual authentication.
                        Default: Simple authentication.
  --keyfile keyfile     Client private key file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. Not required if private key is part of the
                        certfile option. Not allowed if no certfile option.
                        Default: No client key file. Client private key should
                        then be part  of the certfile

General options:
  -s [scripts [scripts ...]], --scripts [scripts [scripts ...]]
                        Execute the python code defined by the script before the
                        user gets control. This argument may be repeated to load
                        multiple scripts or multiple scripts may be listed for a
                        single use of the option. Scripts are executed after the
                        WBEMConnection call
  -v, --verbose         Print more messages while processing
  -V, --version         Display pywbem version and exit.
  --statistics          Enable gathering of statistics on operations.
  --mock-server [file name [file name ...]]
                        Activate pywbem_mock in place of a live WBEMConnection
                        and compile/build the files defined (".mof" suffix or
                        "py" suffix. MOF files are compiled and python files
                        are executed assuming that they include mock_pywbem
                        methods that add objects to the repository.
  -l log_spec[,logspec], --log log_spec[,logspec]
                        Log_spec defines characteristics of the various named
                        loggers. It is the form:
                         COMP=[DEST[:DETAIL]] where:
                           COMP:   Logger component name:[api|http|all].
                                   (Default=all)
                           DEST:   Destination for component:[file|stderr].
                                   (Default=file)
                           DETAIL: Detail Level to log: [all|paths|summary] or
                                   an integer that defines the maximum length of
                                   of each log record.
                                   (Default=all)
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
