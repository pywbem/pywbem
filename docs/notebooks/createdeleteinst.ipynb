    "The creation of a CIM instance and in turn the creation of the underlying managed resource is achieved by calling the [`CreateInstance()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.CreateInstance) method. It takes a [`pywbem.CIMInstance`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.CIMInstance) object as input, which specifies the class and the initial properties for the CIM instance to be created, and returns a [`pywbem.CIMInstanceName`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.CIMInstanceName) object that references the new CIM instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`DeleteInstance()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.DeleteInstance) method takes a [`pywbem.CIMInstanceName`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.CIMInstanceName) object and deletes the referenced CIM instance and the represented managed resource, or rejects the operation if deletion is not supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some CIM classes, it makes no sense to support creation or deletion of their CIM instances. For some others, that makes sense and is defined in their usage definitions in WBEM Management Profiles (see DMTF standard DSP1001). Often, management profiles that define a semantics for the creation or deletion of managed resources, leave that optional for an implementation to support. The implementation for a CIM class in the WBEM server (aka CIM provider) thus may or may not support creation or deletion of its instances and the represented managed resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `CIMInstance` object provided as input to `CreateInstance()` does not specfify an instance path (or if it does, it will be ignored). The determination of an instance path for the new CIM instance is completely left to the CIM provider in the WBEM server. For CIM classes with natural keys (key properties other than \"InstanceID\"), some CIM providers do honor initial values for some or all of the key properties provided in the input instance."
