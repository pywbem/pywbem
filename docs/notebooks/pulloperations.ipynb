    "The Pull Enumerate Instances request operation sequence differs from the [`EnumerateInstances()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstances) request in that it consists of multiple of operations, an [`OpenEnumerateInstances()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances) operation and corresponding [`PullInstancesWithPath()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath) operations. The [`OpenEnumerateInstances()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances) opens an enumeration sequence and optionally acquires instances from the server determined by the `MaxObjectCount` parameter.  It returns a named tuple that defines the sequence, marks, the end of the sequence, and includes instances retrieved by the [`OpenEnumerateInstances()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances) operation.\n",

    "* `eos` - End-Of-Sequence Boolean flag indicating whether the server has more to instances/paths to deliver.\n",
    "* `context` - Opaque string that provides context between open, pull and close operations within a single enumeration sequence.\n",
    "* `instances` - A list of [`pywbem.CIMInstance`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.CIMInstance) objects for each CIM instance of a particular CIM class (and its subclasses). The CIM instance path is part of the returned instance objects and can be accessed via their `path` attribute returned for this request operation. The instances may be a partial or complete response depending on the result.eos flag.\n",

    "The [`PullEnumerateInstancesWithPath()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath) method returns a named tuple containing the same named elements as the [`OpenEnumerateInstances()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances) above (eos, context, instances). Note that while the MaxObjectCount parameter is an option with the open request (the default is zero) it is a required parameter with the pull request.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this code, the received results are accumulated into the `insts` list.  They could also be processed directly after each response is received. The only caution is that if they are processed immediatly, the client must understand that the response sequence could end early and incomplete if an exception is received and the client must account for this incomplete response in its processing.\n"
