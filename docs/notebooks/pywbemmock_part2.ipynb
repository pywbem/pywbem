    "# Creating a repository from DMTF Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to creating a repository with specifically defined classes, qualifier declarations and instances the repository can be created using the published DMTF schema as the source for qualifier declarations and classes.  The DMTF schema is released on a regular basis with new functionality, fixes, etc. And is published on the DMTF web site. It includes the set of CIM qualifier declarations defined by the DMTF and the CIM classes that make up the CIM model. It is available in both MOF and XML formats.  The method documented here uses the MOF files as the basis for creating CIM qualifier declarations and CIM classes in the mock repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this method requires that you make the following decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which version of the published DMTF released schema you intend to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Where in your local environment do you want to save and expand the schema. This should be a directory and serves both as the storage space for download and expansion and the location checked before download so that the schema is not downloaded each time it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use of the experimental schema for the defined DMTF schema release as well as the released schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The leaf classes you need. The method takes responsibility for determining superclasses and other required classes ( ex. associations, embedded instances) defined in the mof for any of the leaf classes you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example defines a DMTF schema version, the destination directory, and the leaf classes of interest and then calls the compile_dmtf_schema method to create a mock repository. At the end of the operation, the mock repository is includes the complete DMTF set of qualifier declarations (there are only about 100 of them) and the classes you specified and their dependencies.  The destination directory should also include the complete download from the DMTF and the expanded mof files for the qualifier declarations and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: that each time you call compile_dmtf_schema he installs the complete set of qualifier declarations in the mock repository so that it is best to create a complete list of leaf classes required an call this method only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: Some of these cells create new objects on the server. Once those objects are created, they cannot simply be\n",
    "recreated on the server so the repeated execution of some of the cells without restarting (see Kernel in the menu) will\n",
    "cause exception returns from the server.\n"
