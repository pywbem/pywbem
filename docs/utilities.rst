WBEM utility commands
=====================

The pywbem package provides a number of WBEM utility commands.
They are all implemented as pure-Python scripts.

These commands are installed into the Python script directory and should
therefore automatically be available in the command search path.

The following commands are provided:

* :ref:`mof_compiler`

  A MOF compiler that takes MOF files as input and updates the CIM repository
  of a WBEM server with the result.

* :ref:`wbemcli`

  A WBEM client in the form of a shell that provides an interactive Python
  environment for issuing WBEM operations to a WBEM server.

.. _`mof_compiler`:

mof_compiler
------------

The ``mof_compiler`` command compiles MOF files and updates the CIM repository
of a WBEM server with the result.

If the compiler fails, any changes made to the CIM repository in the WBEM server
as part of the current compilation are rolled back. A limitation is that
changes to qualifier declarations are not yet rolled back (see issue #990).

The compiler provides a dry-run mode that simulates the compilation but does not
change the CIM repository in the WBEM server.

Here is the help text of the command:

.. include:: mof_compiler.help.txt

.. _`wbemcli`:

wbemcli
-------

The ``wbemcli`` command is a WBEM client in the form of a shell that provides
an interactive Python environment for issuing WBEM operations to a WBEM
server.

**Deprecated:** The ``wbemcli`` command has been deprecated in pywbem 0.15.0.
Version 1.0.0 of pywbem will remove the ``wbemcli`` command. The recommended
replacement is to use the ``pywbemcli`` command from the
`pywbemtools package on Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/pywbemtools/>`_`.

See :ref:`Python functions in wbemcli` for details on the Python functions
available in that environment.
