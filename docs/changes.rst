pywbem 1.7.0
------------

This version contains all fixes up to version 1.6.3.

Released: 2024-04-15

**Incompatible changes:**

* Dropped support for Python 3.5. (issue #2867)

* In order to make life easier for people that package pywbem into Linux
  distros, vendorized the nocasedict and nocaselist packages. They have been
  removed from the package dependencies. (issue #3141)

* The 'pywbem.ValueMapping' class will now raise a 'pywbem.ModelError' for any
  missing or extra items in the 'Values' qualifier, compared to the 'ValueMap'
  qualifier. Previously, 'IndexError' was raised. (issue #2991)

* Installation of this package using "setup.py" is no longer supported.
  Use "pip" instead.

* Update to support urllib3 dependent package version 2.0+ for Python
  version 3.7+ which limits the SSL library implementations (ex. OpenSSL,
  libreSSL) and requires TLS protocol >=1.2 (ex. OpenSSL versions >= 1.1.1).
  Pins urllib3 version to < 2.0 for Python versions < 3.7. Note that
  pywbem 1.6 actually allows urllib3 version 2+ usage because the requirements version
  specification was not pinned. However, the minimum Python
  version for urllib3 version 2.0+ is now Python 3.7. If an older OpenSSL or
  incompatible SSL library is used, the import of urllib3 package or
  communication with a WBEM server can cause exceptions. See pywbem issue #1302
  and the pywbem documentation
  `trouble shooting <https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendix.html#troubleshooting>`_
  for more information.

**Bug fixes:**

* Addressed safety issues up to 2024-03-27.

* Addressed Dependabot issues up to 2024-03-27.

* Fixed a doc build issue with Sphinx 6.x (issue #2983) and addressed
  some of the Sphinx warnings during doc build.

* Fixed coveralls issues with KeyError and HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity.

* Circumvented the removal of Python 2.7 from the Github Actions plugin
  setup-python, by using the Docker container python:2.7.18-buster instead.

* Fixed missing dependencies in minimum-constraints.txt.

* dev: Fixed UnboundLocalError for membername in Sphinx autodoc.

* Test: Circumvented a pip-check-reqs issue by excluding its version 2.5.0.

* Development: Fixed dependency issue with safety 3.0.0 by pinning it.

* Test: Upgraded GitHub Actions plugins to use node.js 20.

* Test: Fixed issues resulting from removal of support for pytest.warns(None)
  in pytest version 8. (issue #3114)

* Fixed new Pylint issue for unused variable 'exp_result'. (issue #3113)

* Test: Fixed issue in test_recorder.py where format of OrderDict repl output
  changed with python 3.12 (see issue #3097)

**Enhancements:**

* The 'pywbem.ValueMapping' class now allows controlling what should happen
  when the 'Values' qualifier has missing or extra items compared to the
  'ValueMap' qualifier, by means of a new 'values_default' parameter of
  the respective factory methods. If 'values_default' is None (default), a
  'pywbem.ModelError' is raised for missing or extra 'Values' items. If it
  specifies a string value, missing items in the 'Values' qualifier are
  filled up with that value, and extra items in the 'Values' qualifier are
  truncated. (issue #2991)

* Add end-end test for indications where an OpenPegasus server in Docker
  container is the WBEM Server and pywbem is both the client that creates
  indication subscriptions the indication listener. This test uses the
  OpenPegasus container used for other end-end tests.

* Split safety run out of "check" make target ino a separate "safety" make target
  and moved its run to the end of the test workflow.

* Update handling of request exceptions in CIM_http.py to account for changes
  to the urllib3 exceptions API that occurred in urllib3 version 2.0.0 and
  keep the capability to handle the urllib3 exceptions API prior to versiion
  2.0. (see issue #3006)

* Add end2end tests for operation timeout. (see issue #2181)

* Split safety runs into an 'install' and an 'all' run. The install run
  uses a new minimum-constraints-install.txt file that contains just the
  direct and indirect install dependencies and must succeed. The 'all' run
  uses the minimum-constraints.txt file which includes the
  minimum-constraints-install.txt file and that run must succeed when releasing
  a version, but may fail otherwise (in scheduled runs or normal runs).
  This reduces the burden of fixing safety issues that affect only development
  packages.

* Document the issue and possible corrections for the pywbem listener possibly
  losing indications.  Modifies the indication tests in the examples directory
  to give better visibility and control of what these examples are doing.
  See the documentation troubleshooting section. See issue #3022.

**Cleanup:**

* Replaced the safety_ignore_opts in Makefile that is used as the basis for
  ignoring safety issues with the use of a .safety_policy_file defined by
  the safety utility.

* Add a number of new ignores for additions to the safety issues lise May
  2003

* Clarified the use of the host parameter on the WBEMListener class.  (see
  issue #2995)

* Bring example pegasusindicationtest.py up to date and extend to be used
  with WBEM server in a container. (see issue #2993)

* Update dev-requirements.txt, minimum-constraings.txt, .safety_policy.json for
  new safety issues with GitPython and add ruamel-yaml.

* Disable cyclic-import pylint warning.

* Fix issue in pywbem_mock._base_provider where __repr__ had invalid parameter
  (see issue #3036)

* Fix new feb 2024 safety issues, GitPython, Jinja2, JupyterLab. Added to
  safety ignore and fixed in requirements files.

* Extend support to Python  version 3.12 (see issue #3098). This includes
  changes to package version requirements in requirements.txt,
  dev-requirements.txt, minimum_constraints.txt

* Add ignore for gitpython new safety issue 2024-2.

* Moved the version constraints for the 'idna' package into the pywbem
  installation dependencies since it is an indirect dependency (pywbem ->
  requests -> idna).

* Changed the format of the README and README_PYPI files from RST to Markdown,
  to address formatting issues with badges on the Github site (issue #3133).


pywbem 1.6.0
------------

Released: 2023-01-14

**Bug fixes:**

* Fix issue where we could get HTTP retries upon HTTP read timeouts from
  the server.  Changed to not allow urllib3 to do retries on post
  operations (the CIM/XML operations all use post and duplicates of
  some operations (invoke, update) could cause data integrity issues).
  (see issue #2951)

**Enhancements:**

* Support for Python 3.11. (issue #2904)

**Cleanup:**

* Ignore new safety issues for wheel, safety, and py packages and update
  values in minimum-requirements.txt.

* Update github actions matrix to restore tests to running after github
  update of ubuntu-latest to v 22.04.  This is because python
  versions 3.5 and 3.6 cannot be installed with setup-python github action for
  CI tests and ubuntu-22.04. (see pywbemtools issue # 1245 for details).

* Modify Makefile so safety check does not cause fatal github test failure.
  (see issue #2970)

* Update the version of the OpenPegasus server Docker image used in tests to
  the docker image kschopmeyer/openpegasus-server:0.1.2 which used OpenPegasus
  2.14.3 located in the github OpenPegasus repository. This image is much
  smaller (110 mb) but the same set of models and providers as the previous
  image.

* Modifications and pylint ignore statements for new pylint test for
  dict form dict(a=1) which is slower than {'a':1} and other new tests in
  pylint 2.16.0

* Disable/fix Sphinx WARNING: reference not found messages.  Hide about 270
  msgs because they are probably a Sphinx issue. Fixe about 10 as they were
  docstring formatting issues (see Issue #3065)

**Known issues:**

* See `list of open issues`_.

pywbem 1.5.0
------------

This version contains all fixes up to version 1.4.2.

Released: 2022-10-12

**Incompatible changes:**

* Exceeding the 'WBEMConnection' timeout now results in raising
  'pywbem.TimeoutError' in some cases where previously 'pywbem.ConnectionError'
  was raised. (issue #2853)

* Changed the file permissions of `setup.py` to no longer be executable, in
  order to encourage transition to use `pip install` instead of executing
  `setup.py install`, which was deprecated by setuptools.

* The removal of internal symbols from the 'pywbem_mock' Python namespace may
  cause name errors in your code, if you were using them.
  (related to issue #2888)

* The pywbem_mock default instance writer (pywbem_mock/_instancewriteprovider.py)
  added checks for creation/modification of instances to validate that the
  reference properties of associations define existing instances if the
  property values exist. Previously they validated only the correct value type.
  (see issue #2908, extension to bidirectional inter-namespace associations)

**Bug fixes:**

* Fix issue where the DeepInheritance parameter not passed to the mocker
  OpenEnumerateInstances method so the result is that the mocker always
  uses the default (DeepInheritance=True). (see issue #2839)

* Test: Mitigated incorrect version of testfixtures package on Python 3.5
  by pinning it to <6.4.0 on Python 3.5. (issue #2855)

* Documented that the pywbem MOF compiler does not support the "EmbeddedObject"
  qualifier with a class definition. (issue #2340)

* Docs: Changes in autodocsumm and Sphinx versions to pick up final fix for
  issue #2697.

* Re-enabled pylint on Python 3.5 (issue #2674)

* Increased pylint to >=2.10 on Python >=3.6 to pick up fixes in similarity
  checker and enabled similarity checker again on pylint >=2.10
  (issues #2672, #2673)

* Excluded setuptools 61.0.0 because it breaks installation via "setup.py install"
  (issue #2871)

* Resolved new issues reported by Pylint 2.13 (issue #2870)

* Fixed that the added setup.py commands (test, leaktest, installtest) were not
  displayed. They are now displayed at verbosity level 1 (using '-v').

* Previously, the sending of CIM request messages was retried in case no
  response was received within the timeout. This could potentially have resulted
  in executing operations multipe times. That is an issue for non-idempotent
  operations such as instance creation/deletion or method invocation. Fixed
  that by retrying now only during connection setup, but not for the sending
  of CIM request messages. (issue #2853)

* Changed the default timeout of 'WBEMConnection' from 'None' to 30 seconds.
  This prevents waiting for operation completion forever, by default.
  (issue #2853)

* Pinned "certifi" to <2020.6.20 on Python 2.7 because the install test
  using "setup.py install" started failing because it installed a version
  of certifi on Python 2.7 that properly declares that it requires
  Python >=3.6.

* Added a note to the install section of the documentation that installation
  via `setup.py install` has been deprecated by setuptools.

* Removed internal symbols from 'pywbem_mock' Python namespace, and added the
  'config' submodule to the 'pywbem_mock' Python namespace.
  (related to issue #2888)

* Fixed invalid references in the documentation. As part of that, added class
  'MOFWBEMConnection' to the 'pywbem' namespace, moved class
  'IterQueryInstancesReturn' from the scope of method 'pywbem.IterQueryInstances'
  to the 'pywbem' namespace.
  (issue #2888).

* Fixed the name of the cythonized distribution archive.

* Fixed new formatting issues raised by flake8 5.0.

* Fixed issue in pywbem_mock/_wbemconnection_mock.py add_namespaces where
  namespaces that are added with add_namespace() after an interop provider is
  defined do not show up in the list of namespaces. It now uses
  server.create_namespace() if the interop namespace and namespace provider
  exist. (see issue #2865)

* Fixed a RecursionError exception raised by flake8 on Python 3.6 and 3.7.
  (issue #2922)

* Fixed issue in pywbem_mock instancewrite providers where Create/Modify of
  an instance with reference properties fails if host set in reference property
  (i.e. CIMInstanceName). Now issues a warning and ignores the host value since
  pywbem_mock does not handle cross-host associations. (see issue #2920)

* Fixed python syntax issue in example/pegasus_indication_test.py

**Enhancements:**

* Added support for the new 'CIM_WBEMServerNamespace' class used in the
  DMTF WBEM Server Profile. In addition, the WBEMServer.create_namespace()
  method now uses the same class name for the new namespace that is already
  used for existing namespaces. (issue #2845)

* Docs: Clarified that the timeout parameter in 'WBEMConnection' is for
  completing a CIM operation to a server or a CIM indication delivery to a
  listener. (issue #2853)

* Improved the handling of exceptions raised by the "requests" and "urllib3"
  packages in pywbem, so that more meaningful messages are used.
  Exceeding the 'WBEMConnection' timeout now results in raising
  'pywbem.TimeoutError' in some cases where previously 'pywbem.ConnectionError'
  was raised. (issue #2853)

* Extend pywbem_mock creation of instances of associations to provide for
  bidirectional inter-namespace associations.  Previously cross-namespace
  associations created in pywbem_mock were only visible in the namespace
  in which they were created. (see issue #2908)

**Cleanup:**

* Removed support for Python 3.4. It had been deprecated since pywbem 1.0.0.
  (issue #2829)

* Modified compiler and pywbem_mock to allow creating instances from
  abstract classes because SNIA ignored DMTF rule making this illegal and many
  MOF compilers also ignored it.  Pywbem now issue a warning from the MOF
  compiler if an instance of an abstract class is compiled but complete
  the compile and another warning from pywbem_mock.CreateInstance if the
  instance is for an abstract class. (see issue #2825)

* Fix issues in manual test run_cimoperations.py that resulted from changes
  in the pywbem APIs.  Since this was manual test it was not regularly used.
  Changes included removing tests for extra parameters which now cause
  failure of api.

* Clarify why the iterEnumerateInstances and IterEnumerateInstancePaths
  always return the host name in the response. (see issue #2841)

* Changed build process for distribution archives to use the `build` package.

* Document a limitation in the IterQueryInstances request method (it delivers
  instances for Open/Pull after  the request to the server is complete). (see
  issue #1801)

* Added security issues 50748, 50571, 50664, 50663, 50892, 50885, 50886 to
  Makefile ignore list of new security issue August and September 2022.

* Fixed issue with mock namespace provider that would acreate the
  same namespace twice under some conditions (i.e. same name property but
  different path on CreateInstance. (see issue #2918)


pywbem 1.4.0
------------

Released: 2022-01-01

**Bug fixes:**

* Aligned minimum versions of pip,setuptools,wheel with pywbemtools,
  nocasedict,nocaselist. This increased the minimum version of pip
  on Python 3.5 to fix an issue.

**Enhancements:**

* Improved verbosity of namespace creation and deletion: Added optional
  'verbose' parameters to the create_namecpace() and delete_namespace() methods
  of WBEMServer, and to the add_namecpace() and remove_namespace() methods of
  FakedWBEMConnection (and subsequently to BaseProvider) in the mock support.


pywbem 1.3.0
------------

This version contains all fixes up to version 1.2.1.

Released: 2021-12-04

**Incompatible changes:**

* The `WBEMListener.start()` method may raise new exceptions
  `pywbem.ListenerPortError`, `pywbem.ListenerPromptError` and
  `pywbem.ListenerCertificateError`. The `OSError` and `IOError` exceptions
  raised in earlier versions may still be raised for other, less common cases.
  For details, see the corresponding item in the Enhancements section, below.

* Changed 'SubscriptionManager.add_filter()' method to use the
  'SourceNamespaces' property (allows multiple namespaces) of the
  'CIM_IndicationFilter' class instead of the deprecated 'SourceNamespace'
  property (allows only single namespace).  This changed the name of the
  positional 'source_namespace' parameter to 'source_namespaces`. The new
  parameter allows both string and list of strings as values.

  This change brings the subscription manager in line with the incorporation of
  the 'SourceNamespaces' property made to this CIM class definition
  by DMTF CIM schema release 2.22.0.

  An optional 'source_namespace' keyword parameter has been added to the
  'add_filter()'method to account for any case where a WBEM Server cannot
  handle the SourceNamespaces property. The primary incompatibility will be
  that the instance created for CIM_Indication filter now has a property named
  'SourceNamespaces' instead of 'SourceNamespace'. See further comments below
  and issue #2725.

* Changed the 'SubscriptionManager.add_filter()' method to no longer allow
  specifying the 'filter_id' parameter for permanent filters. The documentation
  had already disallowed that case, but the code allowed it. (issue #2757)

* Added code to fail compile or creation in pywbem_mock of instance of
  Abstract class. Before this the WBEM server might fail the attempt but
  the MOF compiler and pywbem_mock would build the instance
  (see issue # 2742).

* The new simplified format of the automatically generated 'Name' property of
  owned indication filters causes existing filters with the old format to
  be ignored and a Python warning of type 'pywbem.OldNameFilterWarning' will be
  issued. Such owned filter instances need to be either removed as owned filters
  with a prior version of pywbem, or as permanent filters with this version of
  pywbem. (issue #2765)

* Removed the 'pywbem.WBEMSubscriptionManager.add_listener_destinations()'
  method, because the new naming approach for listener destinations requires
  either a name or an ID and that does not work well with supporting multiple
  destinations in one method call. Use the new 'add_destination()' method
  instead. (issue #2766)

* The new simplified format of the automatically generated 'Name' property of
  owned listener destinations causes existing destinations with the old format
  to be ignored and a Python warning of type 'pywbem.OldNameDestinationWarning'
  will be issued. Such owned destination instances need to be either removed as
  owned destinations with a prior version of pywbem, or as permanent
  destinations with this version of pywbem. (issue #2766)

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixes bug in compiler where log of ModifyClass request failure was not
  surrounded by verbose test (if p.parse.verbose:). See pywbemcli issue
  #395,

* Fixes issue where mock add_namespace() fails to correctly add the
  namespace after a namespace provider has been installed. (see #2865)

* Fixes several issues in WBEMSubscriptionManager:

  - Fixed the discrepancy between documentation and code in add_filter()
    regarding 'filter_id', 'name' and ownership type: The only allowed
    combinations are now owned filters with 'filter_id' and permanent filters
    with 'name'. (issue #2757)
  - add_filter() and add_destinations() methods  can no longer modify
    existing instances on the WBEM server. They can only create new instances.
  - Modified the algorithm to determine owned filters and
    instances so they are are correctly recovered from the WBEM server when the
    WBEMSubscriptionManager is restarted (before this they could be returned
    as not-owned object).
  - Change to use WBEM server systemname as the value of the SystemName
    property.
  - Removed code that built instance path for new filter and destination
    instances since that was used only to try to determine if instance existed
    to make the create/modify decision.
  - Added the client host as a component of the Name property for owned
    filters and destinations. (issue #2701).
  - Fix issue where windows indication throughput is very slow.  It is in
    the range of 1 indication every 2 seconds.  The issue is not pywbem but
    windows itself apparently because of hosts file and DNS configuration
    such that using localhost builds in a delay. This can be fixed by using
    an IP address 127.0.0.1 for the indication listener or modifying the hosts
    table in windows. For this test we chose to just change the host name  See
    issue #528)
  - Fixes issue with SubscriptionManager class where add_destinations loses
    the input parameter owned if there are multiple urls in the listener_urls
    parameter (see issue #2715)
  - Fixes issue where add_subscription returned wrong instance if the
    instance already exists. (See issue #2719)
  - Fix issues in SubscriptionManager.add_destination to add optional parameter
    which populates the destination PersistenceType property. (See issue #2712)
  - Add capability to mock subscription providers to execute ModifyInstance
    (See issue #2722)
  - Fixed pywbem_mock and the MOF_compiler to test for creation or compile
    of an instance with a creation class that has the Abstract qualifier. This
    will fail since abstract classes cannot be instantiated. (see issue #2742)
  - Removed use of unittest.Mock in pywbem_mock.FakedWBEMConnection to
    use mock versions of _imethodcall and _methodcall and simply duck typed
    the methods. (see issue #2755)
  - Fixed issue in pywbem SubscriptionManager where duplicate add_destination()
    resulted in good return rather than CIMError.  The code where the
    Name property is different but the URL the same was modified to test for
    both URL and persistence type equality before returning the existing
    instance. (See issue $ 2782)

* Fixes MOF compiler issue  where the compiler was allowing array properties
  to have corresponding instances instantiated with non-array values and
  vice-versa. This now causes a parse error. (See issue # 2786)

* Docs: Fixed an error with the autodocsumm and Sphinx 4.0.0. (issue #2697)

* Jupyter Notebook: Ignored safety issues 40380..40386 in order to continue
  supporting it with Python 2.7. (issue #2703)

* Windows: Removed dependency on bash command in pip upgrade in Makefile.
  (issue #2713)

* WBEM listener: Fixed the incorrect Content-Type header value 'text/html' that
  was set in its export responses by changing that to 'text/xml'.
  (part of issue #2729)

* WBEM listener: Removed the incorrect check for the Accept-Encoding header
  value when processing export requests to be consistent with DSP0200 which
  requires that WBEM listeners must support any value. (part of issue #2729)

* Fixed installation with setup.py on ubuntu for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, by
  pinning yamlloader to <1.0.0. (issue #2745)

* Mitigated Pylint issue 'deprecated-method' when using time.perf_counter()
  on Python versions 3.6 and 3.7. (issue #2768)

* Mitigated new Pylint error 'not-an-iterable' when using 'WBEMServer'
  properties that return lists and use deferred initialization. (issue #2770)

* Security - Added 42218 42253 42254 42297 42298 42203 to safety ignore list.
  These were new safety issues 1 Nov 2021. The modules are all in development,
  and Jupyter notebook.

* Fix incompatibility between Sphinx 1.8.5 (version for python <= 3.5) and
  docutils 0.18.  (See issue # 2787).

* Modified dev-requirements and rtd-requirements to require Sphinx >= 3.54.

* Modify dev-requirements.txt to limit version of more-itertools to  < 8.10.1
  for python < 3.6. See issue #2796

* Fixed new issues raised by Pylint 2.12.1.

* Fixed error when installing virtualenv in install test on Python 2.7.

**Enhancements:**

* Improved the running of indication listeners via `WBEMListener.start()`:

  - The method will now raise a new exception `pywbem.ListenerPortError` when
    the port is in use, instead of the previous `socket.error` on Python 2 and
    `OSError` on Python 3 that had confusing or unspecific error messages.

  - The method will now raise a new exception `pywbem.ListenerCertificateError`
    when using HTTPS and there is an issue with the server certificate file,
    private key file, or invalid password for the private key file, instead of
    the previous `ssl.SSLError` or `OSError` that had confusing or unspecific
    error messages.

  - The method will now raise a new exception `pywbem.ListenerPromptError`
    when using HTTPS and the prompt for the password of the private key file
    was interrupted or ended, instead of the previous `IOError` or `OSError`
    that had unspecific error messages.

  - If the private key file is protected with a password, the password prompt
    now states the path name of the private key file in the prompt message.

  - Add optional initialization parameter `url` to pywbem_mock
    FakedWBEMConnection class. This allows a different URL than the default
    http://FakedWBEMConnection:5988. With this, tests can be executed with
    multiple simultaneous mock environments pywbem. (See issue #2711)

* Test: Added support for validating the structure of user-defined properties in
  the easy-server server and vault files. As part of that, increased the minimum
  version of the 'pytest-easy-server' package to 0.8.0. (issue #2660)

* Added providers to the pywbem_mock environment for the  3 classes required to
  manage subscriptions in a WBEM server.  (See issue #2704)

* Finalized the support for SI units that was experimental so far, i.e. the
  'pywbem.siunit()' and 'pywbem.siunit_obj()' functions. (issue #2653)

* Modify 'SubscriptionManager.add_filter()' to use the CIM_IndicationFilter
  property 'SourceNamespaces' in place of the deprecated 'SourceNamespace'. (see
  issue #2725 and the **Incompatible changes:** section above)

* Added support for the ExportIndication export operation by extending
  'WBEMConnection' to be able of targeting a WBEM listener instead of a WBEM
  server, and by adding an 'ExportIndication()' method to 'WBEMConnection'.
  The 'default_namespace' and 'use_pull_operations' init parameters and
  properties are ignored when targeting a WBEM listener. (issue #2729)

* Test: Improved diff display when assertion in test_recorder.py fails.

* Added toleration support for WBEM servers that return a CIM status
  CIM_ERR_FAILED when pywbem issues a pull operation and the server does not
  support it. Note that DSP0200 requires the use of CIM status
  CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED in this case, but at least one WBEM server returns
  CIM_ERR_FAILED. (issue #2736)

* Added a 'copy()' method to 'WBEMConnection', 'FakedWBEMConnection',
  'LogOperationRecorder', and 'TestClientRecorder'. The 'copy()' method returns
  a copy of the object where user-specified attributes are copied and
  any additional internal state is reset. In case of 'FakedWBEMConnection',
  the repository and registries of the original object are reused by the
  new object. (issue #2750)

* The init methods of 'WBEMConnection' and 'LogOperationRecorder'
  now copy any mutable input arguments in order to ensure the new object is
  decoupled from the user-provided objects. (related to issue #2750)

* Changed the WBEMConnection.timeout property to be settable. This allows
  adjusting the timeout after the connection has been created. (issue #2752)

* Pylint: Removed pinning of Pylint to <2.7.0 because the performance issue
  can also be addressed by disabling the similarity checker, and addressed
  Pylint issues reported by Pylint 2.9. (issue #2672)

* Simplified the format of the automatically generated 'Name' property of owned
  indication filters from:
  ``"pywbemfilter:" {ownership} ":" {client_host} ":" {submgr_id} ":" {filter_id} ":" {guid}``
  to:
  ``"pywbemfilter:" {submgr_id} ":" {filter_id}``.
  The client host was removed in order to allow different client systems to be
  used. The ownership was removed because filters with an auto-generated Name
  are always owned. The GUID was removed to make the name predictable and the
  uniqueness it attempted to guarantee is now achieved by rejecting the creation
  of filters with the same name. Overall, this change makes the name much more
  suitable for use in CLI tools such as pywbemcli. (issue #2765)

* Added a `ToleratedSchemaIssueWarning` class with its base class `Warning`.
  The new `ToleratedSchemaIssueWarning` is expected to be used where the
  MOF compiler or code detects issues in the CIM Schema that are either
  tolerated or corrected.

* Added a 'pywbem.WBEMSubscriptionManager.add_destination()' method
  that makes the way the 'Name' property is created for listener destination
  intances consistent with how that is now done for indication filters: There is
  a new parameter 'name' that directly sets the 'Name' property for permanent
  destinations, and a new parameter 'destination_id' that is used for creating
  the 'Name' property for owned destinations. The format of the generated 'Name'
  property has been changed from:
  ``"pywbemdestination:" {ownership} ":" {client_host} ":" {submgr_id} ":" {guid}``
  to:
  ``"pywbemdestination:" {submgr_id} ":" {destination_id}``.
  The client host was removed in order to allow different client systems to be
  used. The ownership was removed because destinations with an auto-generated
  Name are always owned. The GUID was removed to make the name predictable and
  the uniqueness it attempted to guarantee is now achieved by rejecting the
  creation of destinations with the same name. Overall, this change makes the
  name much more suitable for use in CLI tools such as pywbemcli. (issue #2766)

* Fixed install error of PyYAML 6.0b1 on Python 2.7 during installtest, by
  pinning it to <6.0.

* Fixed install error of wrapt 1.13.0 on Python 2.7 on Windows due to lack of
  MS Visual C++ 9.0 on GitHub Actions, by pinning it to <1.13.

* Fixed install error of yanked jsonschema 4.0.0 on Python <3.7, by excluding it.

* Enhanced test matrix on GitHub Actions to always include Python 2.7 and
  Python 3.4 on Ubuntu, and Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 on macOS and Windows.

* Support for Python 3.10: Added Python 3.10 in GitHub Actions tests, and in
  package metadata.

**Cleanup:**

* Extend tests for SubscriptionManager to utilize pytest and cover error cases.


pywbem 1.2.0
------------

This version contains all fixes up to pywbem 1.1.3.

Released: 2021-04-26

**Incompatible changes:**

* Unsupported CIM infrastructure versions returned in CIM-XML responses from
  WBEM servers are now raised as a new exception `pywbem.CIMVersionError`, and
  were previously raised as `pywbem.CIMXMLParseError`.
  Unsupported DTD versions and CIM-XML protocol versions returned in CIM-XML
  responses from WBEM servers are now raised as new exceptions
  `pywbem.DTDVersionError` and `pywbem.ProtocolVersionError`, and were
  previously ignored by pywbem.
  Since these new exceptions are derived from `pywbem.VersionError` which is
  derived from `pywbem.VersionError`, this change is only incompatible
  if such unsupported versions were specifically handled by users.

* The `pywbem.WBEMServer.get_selected_profiles()` method now raises
  `pywbem.ModelError` instead of `KeyError` when required properties were found
  to be missing. This is an incompatible change for users that catch this
  exception. (related to issue #2580).

* The operation recorder support added in pywbem 0.9 as an experimental feature
  was changed to become internal.
  As part of this, the "WBEM operation recording" section has been removed
  from the documentation, the operation recorder specific classes are
  no longer documented, and the operation recorder specific attributes and
  methods of the 'WBEMConnection' class have been declared to be internal
  and have been removed from the documentation.
  The logging support which uses the operation recorder remains publicly
  available. If you are using the operation recorder, please create an issue in
  the issue tracker describing how you use it.

**Bug fixes:**

* MOF compiler: Fixed bug where MOF compiler did not correctly install a CIM schema
  in a non-default namespace because it tried to get the qualifiers from the
  default namespace. (see issue #2502)

* Test: Changed dependency on 'typed-ast' to match the needs of 'astroid' and to
  install it only on CPython. This allows re-enabling PyPy3 on Travis.

* Test: Pinned psutil to <=5.6.3 on PyPy2+3 to avoid an installation error.

* Test: Increased the minimum version of 'pyzmq' on Python 3.9 to 19.0.0 to
  avoid an installation error.

* Test: Circumvented unicode issue with lxml.etree.fromstring()/XML() on
  Python 3.9 by passing in binary strings.

* Test: Adjusted _format()/_ascii2() testcases to PyPy3 behavior with binary vs
  unicode results.

* Test: Suppressed pylint warning about 'tracemalloc' methods on PyPy.

* Test: Disabled leaktest in travis also on PyPy3 (in addition to PyPy2).

* Test: Disabled 'make resourcetest' in Travis on Pypy2+3, and suppressed Pylint
  issues about using 'tracemalloc' methods and disabled its unit tests.

* Fixed the bug that pywbem allowed reference typed CIMQualifier and
  CIMQualifierDeclaration objects. DSP0004 disallows reference types on
  qualifiers and qualifier declarations. This fix now causes CIM-XML responses
  received from a WBEM server with reference typed qualifier values and qualifier
  declarations to raise `pywbem.CIMXMLParseError` from `WBEMConnection`
  operations.

* Fixed a `DeprecationWarning` issued by urllib3 about using the
  `whitelist_methods` parameter of `Retry`.

* Security: Increased minimum version of 'PyYAML' to 5.2 on Python 3.4 and to
  5.3.1 on Python 2.7 and >=3.5 to address security issues reported by safety.
  The relevant functions of 'PyYAML' are not used by pywbem, though.

* Security: Increased minimum version of 'urllib3' to 1.24.2 on Python 3.4 and
  to 1.25.9 on Python 2.7 and >=3.5 to address security issues reported by
  safety. To support these versions of 'urllib3', increased minimum version of
  'requests' to 2.20.1 on Python 3.4 and to 2.22.0 on Python 2.7 and >=3.5.

* Security: Increased minimum versions of several packages that are needed only
  for test or development of pywbem to address security issues reported by
  safety: requests-toolbelt to 0.8.0; lxml to 4.6.2 (except for Python 3.4);
  pylint to 2.5.2 and astroid to 2.4.0 on Python >=3.5; typed-ast to 1.3.2 on
  Python 3.4; twine to 3.0.0 on Python >=3.6; pkginfo to 1.4.2; bleach to 3.1.2
  on Python 3.4 and to 3.1.4 on Python 2.7 and Python >=3.5.

* Fixed issue on GitHub Actions with macos by no longer running "brew update"
  in pywbem_os_setup.sh. (issue #2544)

* Docs: Fixed incorrect attribute name 'provider_classnames' in method provider
  example. (issue #2564)

* Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning coveralls-python to
  <3.0.0.

* Test: Add tests to test_mof_compiler to test for errors where the namespace
  name component of the namespace pragma is missing.

* In `CIMNamespaceProvider.post_register_setup()`, fixed an `AttributeError`
  when accessing the 'Name' property of a CIM instance (related to issue #2580).

* In the `MOFCompiler` class, fixed that if a MOF instance already exists, the
  ModifyInstance operation failed because the instance path was not specified.
  The fix is to construct the instance path from the key properties in instance
  specified in MOF. That fix has the limitation that it does not account for
  instance providers that add key properties or that ignore provided key
  properties (e.g. InstanceID). (issue #2586)

* Corrected issue in pywbem_mock where DeleteQualifier() was not checking whether
  the qualifier was used in any classes in the namespace before being deleted.
  (see #2585)

* Fixed an incorrect calculation of the min/max values for the server response
  time in the statistics support of pywbem (issue #2599)

* Security - Add safety issue 40072 (lxml version 4.6,3) to safety ignore
  list. No change to pywbem since we apparently do not use the affected
  component (see issue #2645)

* Test: Pinned decorator package to python <=5.0.0 on Python 2+3.4 because
  decorator 5.0.0 does not support python < 3.5 (see issue #2647)

* Fix pywem_mock issue with Delete class not calling providers to handle
  the DeleteInstance (see issue #2643)

* Test: Workaround for BadStatusLine issue in test_WBEMListener_send_indications
  test function. This is not a fix for the root cause of the issue. For details,
  see pywbem issue #2659.

* Fixed installation of 'pywinpty' package on Python 2.7 by pinning it to <1.0.
  It failed because it does not declare its supported Python versions.
  (see issue #2680)

* Fixed that the test workflow ignored errors that occurred during 'make install'
  and 'make develop', by splitting the multiple commands in these steps into
  separate steps.

**Enhancements:**

* Finalized the pywbem mock support. (issue #2651)

* Logging: Added a value 'off' for the log destination in the
  ``pywbem.configure_logging()`` function that disables logging.
  (part of issue #86)

* Improved exception handling during the parsing of CIM-XML responses received
  from a WBEM server. Exceptions that were raised as TypeError or ValueError
  during the creation of CIM objects that are part of the operation result, are
  now raised as pywbem.CIMXMLParseError. Note that this is not an incompatible
  change because users were already potentially getting pywbem.CIMXMLParseError
  exceptions in other cases. (see issue #2512)

* Test: Added CIM-XML testcases in the area of instance paths. (see issue #2514)

* Docs: Clarified that `pywbem.type_from_name()` returns `CIMInstanceName` for
  type name "reference", even though for use in CIM method parameters,
  `CIMClassName` is also valid.

* Issued a new `pywbem.MissingKeybindingsWarning` warning if a `CIMInstanceName`
  object that does not have any keybindings gets converted to CIM-XML by calling
  its `tocimxml()` method, or gets converted to a WBEM URI by calling its
  `to_wbem_uri()` method, or gets parsed from CIM-XML via an INSTANCENAME
  element without keybindings. This is motivated by the fact that DSP0004 does
  not allow instance paths without keys (section 8.2.5). (See issue #2514)

* Reduced memory consumption of CIM objects and CIM types by defining their
  attributes to use Python slots. (see issue #2509)

* Reduced memory consumption of CIM objects by using lazy initialization of
  dictionary-type attributes. This resulted in significant savings when the
  attribute is typically unused, for example in ``CIMInstance.qualifiers``.
  (see issue #2511)

* Added Python 3.9 to the supported Python versions and added tests for
  it on Travis.

* Added a check for the DTDVERSION attribute value in CIM-XML responses from
  WBEM servers to start with '2.'. A different version of the CIM-XML DTD
  standard DSP0203 was never published, so this is not expected to be an
  incompatible change.

* Unsupported versions for CIM infrastructure, DTD or protocol version returned
  in CIM-XML responses from WBEM servers are now raised as new exceptions
  `pywbem.CIMVersionError`, `pywbem.DTDVersionError`, and
  `pywbem.ProtocolVersionError`, respectively. These new exceptions are
  derived from the existing exception `pywbem.VersionError`. Previously,
  unsupported CIM infrastructure versions were raised as
  `pywbem.CIMXMLParseError`, and unsupported DTD or protocol versions were
  ignored by pywbem.

* Removed the pinning of Pylint to 2.5.2 on Python >=3.5. Disabled the following
  warnings that were newly reported by the latest version (2.6.0) of Pylint:
  'signature-differs' because it does not recognize compatible signature changes;
  'raise-missing-from' and 'super-with-arguments' because these issues cannot
  reasonably be addressed as long as Python 2.7 is supported.

* In the makefile, added an ignore list for issues reported by safety along
  with the reasons why each issue is ignored. This allowed enforcing that the
  safety command reports no issues.

* Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This required several
  changes in package dependencies for development.

* Docs: Added examples to the `pywbem.siunit()` and `pywbem.siunit_obj()`
  functions.

* Extend the MOF compiler so that the pywbem_mock can compile MOF containing
  the namespace pragma that defines a namespace other than the one defined in
  the compile_mof_string() or compile_mof_file() methods namespace parameter if
  the namespace exists. Extend documentation on use of the namespace parameter
  to reflect the behavior if the MOF contains a namespace pragma. Since the
  code gives precedence to tha pragma over the namespace specified
  in in the namespace parameter, the documentation reflects this. (see issue
  #2256 partial fix).

* The `pywbem.siunit()` function supported the PUnit format as defined in
  DSP0004. It turned out that the CIM Schema used PUnit qualifiers with a
  slightly extended format where the numeric modifiers were the middle instead
  of just at the end. Extened the PUnit format supported by the `siunit()`
  function accordingly. (issue #2574)

* Improved and fixed the messages in the compile log of class `MOFCompiler`
  and ensured that the target namespace of the compiled objects is included
  in the messages and added messages for changes to the target namespace
  caused by 'pragma namespace' directives.

* The 'mof_compiler' script now displays the compiled objects and their target
  namespace when specifying verbose mode (-v option).

* Improvements in `pywbem_mock.CIMNamespaceProvider` and `pywbem.WBEMServer` to
  more cleanly handle Interop namespaces (related to issue #2580).

* Improvements in the log messages of the `MOFCompiler` class.
  (related to issue #2586)

* Added a `close()` method to `pywbem.WBEMConnection` that closes the underlying
  session of the 'requests' package. This avoids the ResourceWarning
  'unclosed socket' that the 'requests' package issued so far when the Python
  process terminates. Added the ability for `pywbem.WBEMConnection` to be used
  as a context manager, that closes the connection at the end. (see issue #2591)

* Added a mechanism to suspend the statistics counting of server time if
  one or more operations do not return the server response time, in order to
  prevent incorrect interpretations of the counters when only a subset of the
  operations returned server response time. (issue #2603)

* Added validation tests to pywbem_mock ModifyClass to limit classes
  that can be modified (no subclasses, and no instances exist, and
  correct superclass) (see issue #2447)

* Docs: Used 'autodocsumm' Sphinx extension for generating attribute and method
  summary tables for classes in the documentation. Moved documentation of some
  base classes into a new 'Base Classes' section in the appendix.

* Added a `conn_close()` method to the `pywbem.MOFCompiler` class that closes
  the underlying connection. Used that function in the 'mof_compiler' script
  to remove a ResourceWarning about unclosed sockets. (issue #2610)

* Added 'make perftest' to run performance tests. At this point, the performance
  tests measure the sending of indications to the pywbem.WBEMListener.

* Test: Added support for end2end testing of WBEM servers based on server and
  vault files of the 'easy-server' Python package. The server files can specify
  WBEM servers and their expected supported functions. WBEM servers can be
  somewhere in the network or can be containers on DockerHub which are
  automatically pulled and started. At this point, the OpenPegasus container on
  DockerHub is used and the end2end tests are run in the GitHub Actions test
  workflow on Ubuntu (Docker is not available in GHithub Actions on Windows or
  MacOS).

* Dev: Optimized the dependencies in the Makefile such that "make build" does
  not execute the commands again on subsequent invocations. (issue #3167)

**Cleanup:**

* Test: Fixed all remaining ResourceWarnings during test. (issue #86)

* Test: Cleaned up DeprecationWarning for the propagation of key property values
  introduced in pywbem 1.1.0. (see issue #2498)

* Add index section to generated documentation.

* Fixed new issues reported by pylint 2.7.0. At the same time, needed to
  temporarily pin pylint to <2.7.0 and astroid to <2.5.0 due to massive
  elongation of the run time of pylint in the pywbem project.

* Added tests for pywbem_mock ModifyClass request operation to test the
  validation exceptions and correctness of modified class. (see issue #2210)

* Cleaned up TODOs noted in pywbem and pywbem_mock to fix any that were actually
  bugs, etc. and either create issues or mark the others as FUTURE with more
  explanation.  (See issue #2491)

* Enforced that the pywbem source code does not contain any TODOs (pylint fixme).
  Note that the pywbem test code may still contain TODOs.

* Removed remove_duplicate_setuptools.py script since the project is no longer
  using Travis.

**Known issues:**

* On Python 3.4, the urllib3 package is pinned to <1.25.8 because 1.25.9 removed
  Python 3.4 support. As a consequence,
  `safety issue <https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db/blob/master/data/insecure_full.json>`_
  38834 cannot be addressed on Python 3.4.


pywbem 1.1.0
------------

This version contains all fixes up to pywbem 1.0.3.

Released: 2020-10-05

**Deprecations:**

* Deprecated the propagation of key property value changes to corresponding
  path keybindings in `CIMInstance` objects. A DeprecationWarning is now
  issued in that case. A future release of pywbem will remove the propagation.
  If you change key property values of a CIMInstance object that has a path set
  and depend on the corresponding keybinding values in the path to also change,
  then you should now change these keybindings values in your code instead of
  relying on the automatic propagation.

  Reasons for this deprecation are:

  - There are valid scenarios to have the keybindings different from the key
    properties, for example when passing an instance to the ModifyInstance
    operation that attempts to modify the key property values of an instance.

  - A propagation in the opposite direction was missing, so the approach did
    not ensure consistency of the `CIMInstance` object anyway.

  - Propagating the update of a key property value to the path is a hidden
    side effect and complicates an otherwise simple operation.

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed erronously raised HeaderParseError when WBEM server returns
  Content-type: text/xml. This content-type is valid according to DSP0200.
  Added testcases. (See issue #2420)

* Fixed handling of ReturnQueryResultClass=True in
  WBEMConnection.OpenQueryInstances(). (See issue #2412)

* Mock: In the mock support, fixed multiple errors in the mocked
  OpenQueryInstances(), and added testcases for it. (See issue #2412)

* Test: Fixed dependency issues with 'pyrsistent' package on Python 2.7 and
  Python 3.4.

* Increased minimum versions of nocasedict to 1.0.0 and nocaselist to 1.0.2
  to pick up fixes needed for pywbem.

* Windows install: Upgraded WinOpenSSL to 1.1.1h.

* Upgraded the minimum versions of nocasedict to 1.0.3 and of nocaselist to
  1.0.1, to pick up fixes in these packages.

* Test: Fixed ResourceWarning that was issued due to not closing a MOF compiler
  log file used during tests. (see issue #2487)

**Enhancements:**

* Mock: Added load() methods to the ProviderRegistry and InMemoryRepository
  classes, in support of caching mock environments. They replace the data of
  the target object with the data from a second object. That is needed for
  restoring these objects from a serialization, because multiple other objects
  have references to these objects which requires that the object state can
  be set without having to create a new object.

* Mock: Added an iteritems() method to the ProviderRegistry class that
  iterates through the flattened list of providers, represented as tuples.

* Mock: Added support for more ways the output parameters can be returned
  in method providers: The container for the output parameters can now also
  be a Mapping (including pywbem's internal NocaseDict or nocasedict.NocaseDict),
  in addition to just the built-in dict. The values in such a Mapping container
  can now also be CIMParameter objects, in addition to just the CIM data values.
  This provides consistency with the way the input parameters of the method
  provider are represented. (See issue #2415)

* Added time statistics support to pywbem_mock, that allows measuring which
  parts of the setup and execution of a mock environment takes how much time.
  (Part of issue #2365)

* Added a new method ``is_subclass()`` to ``WBEMConnection`` that checks whether
  a class is a subclass of a class. Both classes can be specified as classnames
  or as ``CIMClass`` objects.

* Added support for translating the values of ``PUnit`` and ``Units``
  qualifiers into human readable SI conformant unit strings, via new
  functions ``pywbem.siunit_obj()`` and ``pywbem.siunit()``. These new
  functions are marked as experimental. (See issue #2423)

* Mock: Added a new property ``provider_dependent_registry`` to
  ``FakedWBEMConnection`` which is a registry of provider dependent files. This
  registry can be used by callers to register and look up the path names of
  additional files in context of a mock script. This ability is used by the
  pywbemtools project to validate whether its mock cache is up to date w.r.t.
  these files.

* Test: The testcases using the ``simplified_test_function`` decorator
  now verify that no warnings are issued. Previously, not expecting warnings
  in a testcase caused warnings that occurred to be tolerated.
  Adjusted some code in pywbem and in testcases to accomodate that. Fixed the
  ResourceWarning in validate.py.

* Test: When testing with latest package levels, the package versions of
  indirect dependencies are now also upgraded to the latest compatible
  version from Pypi. (see issue #2485)

**Cleanup:**

* Mock: Cleaned up the output of repr(BaseProvider) to no longer show the
  CIM repository, and to include the other attributes that were not shown so
  far. (See issue #2432)

* Complete pywbem_mock tests that were documented as missing in issue.
  (see issue # 2327)

* Removed dependency on package custom-inherit and removed package from
  pywbem.  (see issue # 2436)

* Test: Changed collection of .yaml files in function tests to address
  DeprecationWarning issued by pytest (see issue #2430).

* Fix issue where pywbem_mock would accept a CreateClass where the qualifier
  scopes did not match the corresponding QualifierDeclarations (See issue #2451)

* Fixed issue where pywbem_mock CreateClass was not testing for class
  dependencies (reference classes and EmbeddedObject classes). (see issue
  #2455)

* Fixed issue where compiler would fail of a EmbeddedObject qualifier
  defined Null (None) as the embedded object class.

* Fixed issue where mof compiler asserts if the creation of new class fails
  because of reference or embedded object depency failures. Changed to
  a MOFDependencyError exception (see issue # 2458)

* Added test with mocker to demonstrate that a ModifiedInstance with
  key property modified results in PARAMETER_ERROR. (see issue #2449)

* Complete test of embedded instances. (see issue #464)


pywbem 1.0.0
------------

Released: 2020-08-08

**Enhancements:**

* Improved logging in WBEM listener and its test module.


pywbem 1.0.0b4
--------------

Released: 2020-08-02

**Incompatible changes:**

* Removed the following classes that were providing support for UNIX Domain Socket
  based connections:

  - `PegasusUDSConnection`
  - `SFCBUDSConnection`
  - `OpenWBEMUDSConnection`

  They are no longer supported since moving to the 'requests' package.

* Updated the change history of 1.0.0b1 to mention one more incompatible change
  where support was removed for specifying multiple directory paths or file paths
  from the `ca_certs` parameter of `WBEMConnection`. Now, only a single
  directory path or file path can be specified, or `None`.

* The use of NocaseDict from the nocasedict package caused the CIM objects that
  have a dictionary interface (i.e. CIMInstance and CIMInstanceName), and all
  CIM object attributes that are dictionaries (e.g. CIMInstance.properties) to
  now behave consistent with the built-in dict class. This causes the following
  incompatibilities:

  - The update() method now supports only a single (optional) positional
    argument. Previously, multiple positional arguments were supported.

  - The iterkeys(), itervalues(), and iteritems() methods are no longer
    available on Python 3. Use the keys(), values(), or items() methods
    instead.

  - The keys(), values(), and items() methods now return a dictionary view
    instead of a list. That no longer allows modifying the dictionary while
    iterating over it. Create a list from the result of these methods and
    iterate over the list, if you have to delete dictionary items while
    iterating.

  - CIM object attributes that are dictionaries can no longer be set to
    None (which previously caused the dictionary to be empty). Set such
    attributes to an empty iterable instead, to get an empty dictionary.

  - Changed the exception that is raised when CIM object attributes
    are set with an unnamed key (None) from TypeError to ValueError.

* The dictionary view objects that are now returned on Python 3 by
  CIMInstance.values() and CIMInstance.items() can no longer be used to iterate
  over when the underlying properties dictionary is modified in the loop.
  The returned dictionary view raises RuntimeError if the dictionary is
  modified while iterating, so that case is properly detected.
  Put list() around the calls to these methods if you need to modify the
  underlying properties dictionary in the loop. (See issue #2391)

**Deprecations:**

* Deprecated the iterkeys(), itervalues() and iteritems() methods of
  CIMInstance and CIMInstanceName on Python 3, to be more consistent with the
  built-in dict class that does not support these methods on Python 3. Use the
  keys(), values() or items() methods instead. (See issue #2372)

**Bug fixes:**

* Test: Fixed issue with Swig when installing M2Crypto on native Windows in the
  Appveyor CI, reporting mssing files swig.swg and python.swg. This was fixed
  by pinning the swig version to 4.0.1 in pywbem_os_setup.bat. This fix only
  applies to pywbem versions before 1.0.0, but is needed in 1.0.0 as well,
  because e.g. pywbemtools pulls the fixed pywbem_os_setup.bat file from the
  master branch of pywbem (one of the recommended approaches, and the only
  one with a stable URL) (See issue #2359).

* Docs: Fixed the description of return values of the keys(), values() and
  items() methods of CIMInstanceName to state that they return lists on
  Python 2, but dictionary views on Python 3. (See issue #2373)

* Install: Increased the minimum version of six to 1.14.0 (it was 1.12.0 on
  Python 3.8 and 1.10.0 below Python 3.8). (See issue #2379)

* Test: Added libffi-devel as an OS-level package on CygWin, it is needed by
  the Python cffi package which recently started to be needed.
  (See issue #2394)

**Enhancements:**

* Test: Enabled coveralls to run on all Python versions in the Travis CI,
  resulting in a combined coverage for all Python versions.

**Cleanup:**

* Changed the order of inheriting from mixin classes to put them after the
  main base class, following Python standards for inheritance (issue #2363).

* Docs: Switched to using the sphinx_rtd_scheme for the HTML docs
  (See issue #2367).

* Replaced pywbem's own NocaseDict with NocaseDict from the nocasedict package
  and adjusted code and testcases where needed. See also the
  'Incompatible changes' section. (See issue #2356)

* Improved the values() and items() methods of CIMInstance on Python 3 to
  return a dictionary view object instead of a list, to improve performance
  and for consistency with Python 3 behavior of the built-in dictionary. The
  keys() method already returned a dictionary view object on Python 3.
  The value item in each iteration is the same as before this change, i.e. the
  CIMProperty.value attribute. (See issue #2391)


pywbem 1.0.0b3
--------------

Released: 2020-07-15

**Incompatible changes:**

* Removed the deprecated `compile_dmtf_schema()` method in `FakedWBEMConnection`
  in favor of a new method `compile_schema_classes()` that does not automatically
  download the DMTF schema classes as a search path, but leaves the control
  over where the search path schema comes from, to the user. (See issue #2284)

  To migrate your existing use of `compile_dmtf_schema()` to the new approach,
  the code would be something like::

      schema = DMTFCIMSchema(...)
      conn.compile_schema_classes(class_names, schema.schema_pragma_file, namespace)

* Removed the deprecated `schema_mof_file` property in `DMTFCIMSchema`, in favor
  of the `schema_pragma_file` property. (See issue #2284)

* Changed the handling of invalid types of input parameters to WBEMConnection
  operation methods to raise TypeError instead of other exceptions (KeyError,
  AttributeError, CIMError). This does not change the behavior if valid types
  are passed. (See issue #2313)

* Mock support: Changed the interface of user-defined providers in order to
  simplify their implementation. (See issue #2326)

**Bug fixes:**

* Test: On Python 3.8, upgraded the minimum version of lxml from 4.4.1 to 4.4.3,
  in order to fix an XMLSyntaxError raised when encountering UCS-4 characters.
  (See issue #2337)

**Enhancements:**

* Test: Added support for testing from Pypi/GitHub source distribution archives.
  This allows testing without having to check out the entire repository, and
  is convenient for testing e.g. when packaging pywbem into OS-level packages.
  See new section 'Testing from the source archives on Pypi or GitHub'
  for details. (See issue #2260)

* Test: Renamed the 'end2end' target in the makefile to 'end2endtest'.
  (Part of issue #2260)

* Added type checking for input parameters to WBEMConnection operation methods.
  Previously, invalid types could cause various exceptions to be raised,
  including KeyError, AttributeError, or CIMError. Now, all invalid types are
  properly checked and cause TypeError to be raised. Added testcases
  for invalid types. (See issue #2313)

* Mock support: Simplified the user-defined providers by checking their input
  parameters and the related CIM repository objects as much as possible before
  calling the providers. Updated the provider documentation to be from a
  perspective of the provider, and clarified what is already verified when the
  provider is called. This resulted in some incompatible changes at the
  interface of user-defined providers. (See issue #2326)

* Reworked the documentation about the mock WBEM server, specifically the
  sections about user-defined providers (See issue #2290).

* Enhance MOF compiler to correctly process MOF that contains instance
  definitions with properties that have EmbeddedObject or EmbeddedInstance
  qualifiers.  In this case, the property value is defined in the MOF as
  a string or array of strings that compiles to a CIMInstance.  This
  change does not compile CIMClass definitions.
  Originally these compiled objects were passed through the compiler as
  strings. (See issue # 2277).

* Mock support: Added a method BaseProvider.is_subclass() that tests whether
  two CIM classes in the CIM repository have an inheritance relationship.
  Used the new method for checking the class of embedded instances against the
  class specified in the EmbeddedInstance qualifier. (Related to issue #2326)

**Cleanup:**

* Document the TODOs in pywbem_mock and
  tests/unittest/pywbem_mock.test_wbemconnection.py and create an issue to
  document these issues (issue #2327) except for the ones we fixed in place or
  removed because they are obsolete.  (See issue #1240)

* Corrected issue in the Jupyter notebook pywbemmock to reflect the incompatible
  changes for pywbem mock including 1) the change of the method
  compile_dmtf_schema to compile_dmtf_classes, and the replacement of the
  InvokeMethod callback mechanism to define a method provider with the
  user-defined method provider. (see issue #2310)


pywbem 1.0.0b2
--------------

Released: 2020-06-29

This version contains all fixes up to 0.17.3.

**Bug fixes:**

* Change log: Reintegrated the original change log sections for 0.14.1 to 0.17.2
  and removed the matching change log entries from the change log section for
  1.0.0b1. This reduces the change log entries shown for 1.0.0b1 to just the
  changes relative to 0.17.2. (See issue #2303)

* Fixed slow performance for EnumerateClasses operation in mock WBEM server.
  (See issue #2314)

* Updated change history of 1.0.0b1 to add a bug fix for accomodating the newly
  released flake8 version 3.8.1 by removing the pinning of pyflakes to <2.2.0,
  and adjusting the source code of pywbem to get around the new flake8 messages
  E123, E124, E402.

**Enhancements:**

* Added support for array-typed elements to pywbem.ValueMapping.
  (See issue #2304)


pywbem 1.0.0b1
--------------

Released: 2020-06-24

This is a beta version of the upcoming version 1.0.0. Pip will only install
this version if explicitly requested, e.g. using any of these commands::

    $ pip install pywbem==1.0.0b1
    $ pip install --pre pywbem

**Incompatible changes:**

Because pywbem 1.0.0 is a major change, a number of significant incompatibilites
have been incorporated. The following subsections summarize these changes and provide
details of the changes themselves and the reasons for the changes.

*Summary of incompatible changes:*

The details, alternatives, and reasons for these incompatible changes is shown
below this list.

* Removed Python 2.6 support.

* Migrated pywbem to use the 'requests' Python package for HTTP/HTTPS pywbem
  client to WBEM server communication. This caused some restrictions, see
  the detailed decription of incompatible changes, below.

* Removed the following deprecated functionality:

  - `WBEMConnection` `verify_callback` init parameter.
  - `WBEMConnection` `**extra` keyword arguments from operation methods.
  - Ordering for `NocaseDict`, `CIMInstanceName`, `CIMInstance` and `CIMClass`
    objects.
  - `WBEMConnection` properties: `url`, `creds`, `x509`, `ca-certs`,
    `no_verification`, and `timeout` setter methods. They are now read-only
  - `WBEMConnection` `method_call()` and imethod_call()` methods.
  - `WBEMConnection` `operation_recorder` property.
  - `CIMInstance` property `property_list` and the same-named init parameter.
  - `pywbem.tocimxml()` support for value of `None`.
  - `CIMInstance.tomof()`  `indent` parameter.
  - `pywbem.byname()` internal function.
  - `pywbem.tocimobj()` function.
  - `wbemcli` command.

* Made the `MOFWBEMConnection` class (support for the MOF compiler) internal.

* Changed exceptions behavior:

  - MOF compilation methods of `MOFCompiler` and `FakedWBEMConnection` raises
    exceptions based on class `pywbem.MOFCompileError`.
  - Some methods of `ValueMapping` to use `pywbem.ModelError`.
  - Some methods of `WBEMServer` to raise the new exception `pywbem.ModelError`.
  - `WBEMConnection` request method responses added a new exception
    `pywbem.HeaderParseError` derived from `pywbem.ParseError`.

* Made all sub-namespaces within the pywbem namespace private, except for
  'pywbem.config'.

* Mock WBEM Server (experimental):

  - Replaced the `add_method_callback()` method  in
    `FakedWBEMConnection` with user-defined providers.
  - Removed the `conn_lite` init parameter and mode of `FakedWBEMConnection`.
  - Changed the logging behavior of the MOF compilation methods of
    `FakedWBEMConnection` so that the default is for the caller to display
    exceptions rather than the MOF compiler logger.
  - Changed the default behavior to ignore `IncludeQualifiers` and
    `IncludeClassOrigin` parameters for GetInstance and EnumerateInstances
    operations of the mock WBEM server.

*Incompatible change details:*

* Removed Python 2.6 support. The Python Software Foundation stopped supporting
  Python 2.6 in October 2013. Since then, many Python packages have continued
  releasing versions for Python 2.6, including pywbem. In 2017 and
  2018, a number of Python packages have removed support for Python 2.6 and it
  has become an increasingly difficult task for pywbem to keep supporting
  Python 2.6. For this reason, Python 2.6 support has been removed from pywbem
  in its 1.0.0 version.
  This allowed eliminating a lot of Python version dependent code,
  eliminating the dependency on the unittest2 package, and lifting a number
  of restrictions in test code.

* Migrated pywbem to use the 'requests' Python package for all HTTP/HTTPS
  communication between the pywbem client and the WBEM server replacing httplib
  and different ssl implementations for python 2 and 3. This eliminates
  several python 2/3 pywbem differences and simplifies the installation and setup
  of pywbem.

  This results in the following changes:

  - Changed the behavior of the default value `None` for the `ca_certs`
    parameter of `WBEMConnection`: Previously, it caused the first existing
    directory from a predefined set of directories to be used as the
    certificate directory. Now, it causes the certificates provided by the
    'certifi' Python package to be used. That package provides the Mozilla
    Included CA Certificate List.

  - Removed support for specifying multiple directory paths or file paths
    from the `ca_certs` parameter of `WBEMConnection`. Now, only a single
    directory path or file path can be specified, or `None` (see previous item).

  - A non-existing path specified for the `ca_certs` parameter of
    `WBEMConnection` now raises `IOError`. Previously, the directory or file
    was simply skipped (and subsequently, verification failed).

  - Removed support for the 'OWLocal' authentication scheme that was supported
    for the OpenWBEM server, and the 'Local' authentication scheme that was
    supported for the OpenPegasus server. Pywbem now supports only the 'Basic'
    authentication scheme.

  - Removed support for communicating with WBEM servers using UNIX domain
    sockets by specifying a file-based URL. Use the standard http and https
    protocols instead.

  - The installation of pywbem no longer uses the `pywbem_os_setup.sh/.bat`
    scripts because there are no more prerequisite OS-level packages needed
    for installing pywbem. If you have automated the pywbem installation,
    this step should be removed from your automation.

  - Removal of the `WBEMConnection` `verify_callback` method.

* Removed the `verify_callback` parameter of `WBEMConnection`. It was
  deprecated in pywbem 0.9.0, and was not supported in Python 3. The 'requests'
  package provides the commonly accepted certificate verification within the
  package itself.  (See issue #1928)

* Removed the `**extra` keyword arguments from `WBEMConnection` operation methods.
  Such arguments were passed on to the WBEM server, but they are not needed
  because all parameters defined by the CIM-XML protocol are supported as named
  arguments to these methods. This would only be incompatible if a WBEM server
  supports non-standard parameters or keyword variables were misnamed which
  would have been ignored and not used but now results in exceptions. (See
  issue #1415)

* Removed the deprecated support for ordering `NocaseDict`, `CIMInstanceName`,
  `CIMInstance` and `CIMClass` objects. The ordering of such dictionaries was
  never supported with pywbem on Python 3, and for Python 2 it had been
  deprecated since pywbem 0.12.0. The user should do any required
  ordering. (See issue #1926).

* Removed the deprecated ability to set the following properties of class
  `WBEMConnection`: `url`, `creds`, `x509`, `ca-certs`, `no_verification`,
  and `timeout`. These properties should not be set after the connection is
  defined as the results on the connection are unpreditable.

* Removed the deprecated methods `method_call()` and imethod_call()` and the
  deprecated property `operation_recorder` from class `WBEMConnection`. Users
  should always use the request methods (ex. GetInstance).

* Removed the deprecated property `property_list` and the same-named init
  parameter from class `CIMInstance`. The behavior of this parameter was
  undefined and incomplete.

* Removed the deprecated ability to support a value of `None` for
  `pywbem.tocimxml()`.

* Removed the deprecated `indent` parameter of `CIMInstance.tomof()`.

* Removed the deprecated internal function `pywbem.byname()`.

* Removed the deprecated function `pywbem.tocimobj()`. The replacement for this
  method is to use the function `cimvalue()`.

* Removed the `wbemcli` command that was deprecated in pywbem 0.15.0. The
  recommended replacement is the `pywbemcli` command from the 'pywbemtools'
  package on Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/pywbemtools/. Some of the reasons
  for the removal are: (See issue #1932)

  - Wbemcli did not have a command line mode (i.e. a non-interactive mode), but
    pywbemcli does.
  - The interactive mode of wbemcli was more of a programming environment than
    an interactive CLI, and that makes it harder to use than necessary.
    Pywbemcli has an interactive mode that uses the same commands as in the
    command line mode. If you need an interactive programming prompt e.g. for
    demonstrating the pywbem API, use the interactive mode of the python
    command, or Python's IDLE.
  - Pywbemcli provides more functionality than wbemcli, e.g. server commands,
    persistent connections, class find, instance count, or multiple output
    formats.

* Made the `MOFWBEMConnection` class internal and removed it from the pywbem
  documentation. It has an inconsistent semantics and should not be used by
  users. (See issue #2001).

* Exception changes:

  * Changed the type of exceptions that are raised by methods of
    `pywbem.ValueMapping` for cases where the value-mapped CIM element has
    issues, as follows:

    - From `TypeError` to `pywbem.ModelError`, if the value-mapped CIM element
      is not integer-typed.
    - From `ValueError` to `pywbem.ModelError`, if an item of the `ValueMap`
      qualifier is not an integer.

    The exceptions occur only with model definitions that are invalid and
    do not occur in the CIM Schema published by DMTF.

    This change is incompatible only for users that handle these exceptions
    specifically in their code. (See issue #1429)

  * Changed the exception behavior of the MOF compilation methods of the
    `MOFCompiler` and `FakedWBEMConnection` classes to no longer raise
    `CIMError`, but to raise the following exceptions derived from a new base
    class `MOFCompileError`:

    - `MOFParseError` MOF parsing errors. This class already existed and was
      already used for this purpose.
    - `MOFDependencyError`: New class for MOF dependency errors (e.g. superclass
      not found).
    - `MOFRepositoryError`: New class for errors returned from the target CIM
      repository. The `CIMError` exception raised by the CIM repository is
      attached to that exception in its attribute `cim_error`.

    If you are using these MOF compilation methods, please change your catch
    of exceptions accordingly. (See issue #1235)

  * Changed the `CIMError` exceptions that were raised by pywbem code in several
    `WBEMServer` methods to now raise `ModelError`, for cases where the model
    implemented by the server has issues.
    (See issue #1423)

  * Added a new exception `pywbem.HeaderParseError` derived from
    `pywbem.ParseError` that is used to report HTTP header issues in the CIM-XML
    response. Previously, `HTTPError` had been used for that purpose, misusing
    its integer-typed `status` attribute for the message string. This is actually
    a bug fix, but because it changes the exception type, it is also an
    incompatible change for users that handle exceptions specifically.
    (See issue 2110)

* Made all sub-namespaces within the pywbem namespace private, except for
  pywbem.config. Specifically, renamed the following modules by prepending
  an underscore character: cim_constants.py, cim_http.py, cim_obj.py,
  cim_operations.py, cim_types.py, cim_xml.py, exceptions.py, mof_compiler.py,
  moflextab.py, mofparsetab.py, tupleparse.py, tupletree.py.
  Using these sub-namespaces had been deprecated in pywbem 0.8.0.

  This change is compatible for users that followed the recommendation
  to import only the symbols from the pywbem namespace. Users that imported
  symbols from these sub-namespace should now import them from the pywbem
  namespace. If you miss a symbol in the pywbem namespace, it was likely a
  symbol that is not part of the public pywbem API. (See issue #1925)

* Mock WBEM Server (experimental):

  * Removed the `add_method_callback()` method and the `methods` property
    from the `FakedWBEMConnection` class. This has been replaced by
    the user-defined provider concept where the user defines and registers a
    subclass to the class MethodProvider which implements the InvokeMethod
    responder in that user-defined provider. The 'mock WBEM server' section
    of the documentation and module documentation for the MethodProvider
    and InstanceWriteProvider document creation of unser-defined providers
    (See issue #2062).

  * Removed the `conn_lite` init parameter and mode of operation of
    `FakedWBEMConnection`. The lite mode turned out too simplistic for mock
    testing and of no real value, while adding complexity. Users must include
    classes and qualifier declarations. Most mock environments start with
    classes and qualifier declarations in any case and the tools to add them
    are simple. (See issue #1959)

  * Changed the logging behavior of the MOF compilation methods
    `FakedWBEMConnection.compile_mof_string()` and `compile_mof_file()`
    (consistent with the new `compile_schema_classes()` method) to be able to
    do no logging, by specifying `None` for the `log_func` init parameter of
    `MOFCompiler`. This is now the default.

    MOF compile errors no are longer printed to stdout by default. To continue
    printing the MOF compile errors to stdout, print the exception in your code.
    (See issue #1997)

  * Changed the behavior for the IncludeQualifiers and IncludeClassOrigin
    parameters on the GetInstance and EnumerateInstances operations of the
    mock WBEM server.
    The default is now to ignore the provided parameters and never include
    either attribute in the returned instances whereas, in previous versions the
    provided parameters determined whether they were returned.  This behavior
    may be changed back to how it was in previous versions by modifying config
    variables in the new 'pywbem_mock.config' module.
    Reason for the change was that the behavior of these parameters was
    inconsistent between versions of :term:`DSP0200` and the new behavior
    implements the recommended default behavior. (See issue #2065)

**Deprecations:**

* Deprecated Python 2.7 and 3.4 support in pywbem, that are both beyond their
  End-Of-Life date.

* Deprecated the `compile_dmtf_schema()` method in `FakedWBEMConnection` in
  favor of a new method `compile_schema_classes()` that does not automatically
  download the DMTF schema classes as a search path, but leaves the control over
  where the search path schema comes from, to the user.

* Deprecated the `schema_mof_file` property in `DMTFCIMSchema` in favor of
  a new property `schema_pragma_file` since this is the file that contains all
  of the MOF pragmas defining the locations of the class MOF files in a
  set of directories.

**Bug fixes:**

* Docs: Fixed issues in Listener and SubscriptionManager examples
  (See issue #1768)

* Test: Added testcases to the cim_xml module, and migrated from unittest to
  pytest.

* Fixed a standards compliance issue. DSP0201/203 version 2.4 introduced the
  requirement to set the TYPE attribute on KEYVALUE elements. In operation
  requests sent to the WBEM server, pywbem now sets the TYPE attribute of the
  KEYVALUE element for keybinding values that are specified as CIM data types
  (e.g. pywbem.Uint8, string, bool). For keybinding values that are specified
  as Python int/float types or as None, pywbem continues not to set the TYPE
  attribute on KEYVALUE elements. This is sufficient to be fully standards
  compliant because it is always possible for a user to cause the TYPE attribute
  to be set. In operation responses received from the WBEM server, pywbem
  continues to tolerate an absent TYPE attribute, in order to accomodate WBEM
  servers that implement DSP0201/203 before version 2.4. (See issue #2052)

* Documented the limitation that the `CORRELATOR` element introduced in
  DSP0201/203 version 2.4 is not supported by pywbem. (related to issue #2053)

* Test: Fixed a bug introduced in 0.14.5 where the manualtest scripts failed
  with invalid relative import. (see issue #2039)

* Test: Fixed incorrect coverage reported at the end of the pytest run,
  by increasing the minimum version of the coverage package to 4.5.2.
  (See pywbemtools issue #547)

* Added missing attributes to the test client recorder
  (class TestClientRecorder) (see issue #2118).

* Fixed issue where DMTFCIMSchema/build_schema_mof creates the new cim_schema
  pragma list in order different than the DMTF defined file.  In some rare
  cases this could cause an issue because the DMTF carefully ordered the
  class pragmas to avoid and issues of dependencies, etc. Note that if only
  leaf classes are use there should never be an issue. (See issue # 2223)

* Fixed issue in MOF compiler where compile_string() modifies the
  default_namespace of the MOF_Compiler handle parameter which is some subclass
  of WBEMConnection. This impacts at least the pywbem_mock environment since
  compiling MOF into a namespace that is not the connection default_namespace
  changes the default_namespace to that defined for the compile_string. This
  required extending all subclasses of MOFCompiler.BaseRepository to handle an
  optional namespace parameter on CreateClass, ModifyClass, GetClass,
  CreateInstance, etc. methods including the implementation in pywbem_mock.
  (See issue #2247)

* Removed the incorrect statement about deprecated comparison operators in the
  `NocaseDict` class - these operators had already returned errors.

* Accomodated the newly released flake8 version 3.8.1 by removing the
  pinning of pyflakes to <2.2.0, and adjusting the source code of pywbem
  to get around the new flake8 messages E123, E124, E402.

**Enhancements:**

* For the end2end tests, extended the definitions in
  `tests/profiles/profiles.yml` by the ability to specify the profile version.
  (See issue #1554)

* Improved test coverage of function tests by verifying the last_request,
  last_raw_request, last_reply, and last_raw_reply attributes of a connection.

* Migrated the communication between the pywbem client and WBEM servers to
  to use the 'requests' Python package. This greatly cleaned up the code,
  made the code common again between Python 2 and Python 3, and removed
  any prerequisite OS-level packages, thus simplifying the installation of
  pywbem again to what is expected for a pure Python package.

* Added more unit tests for the cim_http.py module and converted it to
  pytest. (See issue #1414)

* Added a `request_data` attribute to the `HTTPError` and `CIMError`
  exceptions and a `response_data` attribute to the `HTTPError` exception
  for storing the CIM-XML request or response, respectively, in order to
  provide additional context for the error. The `ParseError` exception and its
  subclasses already had `request_data` and `response_data` attributes.
  (See issue #1423)

* Added proxy support to the `WBEMConnection` class, by adding a `proxies`
  init parameter and attribute, utilizing the proxy support of the requests
  package. (see issue #2040)

* Add property to pywbem_mock `FakedWBEMConnection` to allow the user to modify
  the mocker behavior to forbid the use of the pull operations.
  (See issue #2126)

* Refactor pywbem_mock into more consistent components separating the
  mock repository from the component that represents a CIMOM. (see issue # 2062)

* Refactor pywbem_mock to separate the CIM repository from the class
  `FakedWBEMConnection`. This creates a new file _cimrepository.py that
  implements a CIM server repository. (See issue #2062)

* Enhance `FakedWBEMConnection` to allow user-defined providers for specific
  WBEM request operations.  This allows user-defined providers for selected
  instance requests (CreateInstance, ModifyInstance, DeleteInstance) and for
  the InvokeMethod.  Includes the capability to register these providers with
  a method `register_provider` in `FakedWBEMConnection`.  This also creates
  a CIM_Namespace provider to handle the CIM_Namespace class in the interop
  namespace.  See issue #2062)

* Changed format 'standard' of `CIMInstanceName.to_wbem_uri()` to sort the
  keys in the resulting WBEM URI. (See issue #2264)

* Added a new method `FakedWBEMConnection.compile_schema_classes()` that does
  not automatically download the DMTF schema classes as a search path, but
  leaves the control over where the search path schema comes from, to the user.
  See the Deprecations section.

**Cleanup:**

* Improved performance when setting WBEMConnection.debug by prettifying the
  request and reply XML only when actually accessed. (See issue #1572)

* Removed pywbem_mock conn_lite mode. (See issue # 1959)

* Fixed an error in the CIM-XML creation where the IMETHODRESPONSE element did
  not support output parameters. The IMETHODRESPONSE element is not used in the
  pywbem client, though.

* Fixed an error in the CIM-XML creation where the IRETURNVALUE element did not
  support multiple return objects. The IRETURNVALUE element is not used in the
  pywbem client, though.

* Fixed issue where the MOF compiler was using an instance path defined when
  the compiler built the instance as the instance alias instead of the
  instance path returned by the CreateInstance method. The issue is that
  the instance path defined in the compiler may not be complete and the
  only correct instance path is the path returned by the CreateInstance.
  Mof compiler alias now build with return from CreateInstance and the creation
  of the path has been moved from the compiler instanceDeclaration to the
  CreateInstance method defined in the compiler repo.  For the tests that
  means that the path creation is in MOFWBEMConnection.CreateInstance.
  (See issue # 1911)

* Test: Converted WBEMListener tests from unittest to pytest. (See issue #2179)


pywbem 0.17.2
-------------

Released: 2020-04-19

**Bug fixes:**

* Test: Fixed virtualenv related failures during install test.
  (See issue #2174)

* Dev: Increased the versions of the base packages 'pip', 'setuptools' and
  'wheel' to the content of Ubuntu 18.04 as a minimum, and to the lowest
  versions that support a particular Python versions beyond that.
  This only affects development of pywbem. (See issue #2174)

* Setup: Added the scripts for installing OS-level dependencies
  (pywbem_os_setup.sh/.bat) to the source distribution archive. Note that
  starting with the upcoming pywbem 1.0.0, these scripts are no longer needed,
  so this change will not be rolled forward into 1.0.0.
  (See issue #2173)

* Increased the version of 'PyYAML' from 5.1 to 5.3 on Python 2.7, to pick
  up a fix for dealing with Unicode characters above U+FFFF in narrow Python
  builds. This could not be fixed for Python 2.6 since PyYAML 3.12 dropped
  support for Python 2.6 (See issue #2182)

* Fixed raise error for invalid reference_direction in
  WBEMServer.get_central_instances(). (See issue #2187)

* Fixed raise error for missing ports in WBEMListener.__init__().
  (See issue #2188)


pywbem 0.17.1
-------------

Released: 2020-04-13

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed version incompatibilities reported by pip for tox/pluggy,
  ipython/prompt-toolkit, and flake8/pyflakes. (See issue #2153)

* Fixed the issue where formatting the timezone name of a pywbem.MinutesFromUTC
  object raised NotImplementedError, by adding a tzname() method.
  (see issue #2160)

* Pinned mock to <4.0.0 on Python <3.6 due to an install issue when installing
  from the source tarball. (See issue #2150).

* Enabled installation using 'setup.py install' from unpacked source distribution
  archive, and added install tests for various installation methods including
  this one. (See issue #2150).

* Increased minimum version of 'six' from 0.10.0 to 0.12.0 when on Python 3.8
  (or higher). (See issue #2150).

* Increased minimum version of 'setuptools' on Python 3.7 from 33.1.1 to 38.4.1
  to fix a bug with new format of .pyc files. (See issue #2167).


pywbem 0.17.0
-------------

Released: 2020-04-03

**Bug fixes:**

* Test: Fixed a bug introduced in 0.14.5 where the manualtest scripts failed
  with invalid relative import. (see issue #2039)

* Dev: Fixed installation of Jupyter Notebook on Python 3.4 by defining
  the appropriate minimum versions of the ipython package, per Python version.
  (See issue #2135)

* Pinned dparse to <0.5.0 on Python 2.7 due to an issue. (See issue #2139)

**Enhancements:**

* Changed the HTTPS support of `pywbem.WBEMListener` from using the deprecated
  `ssl.wrap_socket()` function to using the `ssl.SSLContext` class that was
  introduced in Python 2.7.9. This causes more secure SSL settings to be used.
  On Python versions before 2.7.9, pywbem will continue to use the deprecated
  `ssl.wrap_socket()` function. (See issue #2002)

**Cleanup:**

* Renamed all sub-modules within the pywbem namespace so they are now private
  (i.e. with a leading underscore). This has been done for consistency with
  the upcoming 1.0.0 version of pywbem, for eaier rollback of changes from
  that version. For compatibility to users of pywbem who use these sub-modules
  directly, despite the recommendation to import only the symbols from the
  pywbem namespace, these sub-modules are still available under their previous
  names.  (See issue #1925)


pywbem 0.16.0
-------------

This version contains all fixes up to pywbem 0.15.0.

Released: 2020-01-09

**Bug fixes:**

* Silenced the MOFCompiler class for verbose=False. So far, it still printed
  messages for generating the YACC parser table, causing one test to fail,
  and others to issue useless prints. (Issue #2004)

* Test: Fixed an error in testing the PLY table version in testcases that caused
  the LEX/YACC parser table files to be written to the pywbem installation
  when using TEST_INSTALLED. (Related to issue #2004)

* Fixed that the MOFCompiler could be created with handle=None to work against
  a local repository. It was documented that way, but failed with
  AttributeError. (See issue #1998)

* Fixed the error that the MOF compilation of a class could fail but the
  error was not surfaced. This only happened when the MOF compiler was invoked
  against a WBEM server, when the class already existed, and when the
  ModifyClass operation that was attempted in this case, failed.

* Fixed that the CIM-XML payload in log entries was spread over multiple lines.
  The payload is now escaped as a single-line Python string.

* Test: Fixed an error in test_format_random() for the backslash character.
  (See issue #2027)

* Fixed handling of Unicode string in ca_certs parm of WBEMConnection on py2
  (See issue #2033)

**Enhancements:**

* Test: Removed the dependency on unittest2 for Python 2.7 and higher.
  (See issue #2003)

**Cleanup**:

* For Python 2.7 and higher, replaced the yamlordereddictloader package with
  yamlloader, as it was deprecated. For Python 2.6, still using
  yamlordereddictloader. (See issue #2008)


pywbem 0.15.0
-------------

This version contains all fixes up to pywbem 0.14.6.

Released: 2019-12-01

**Deprecations:**

* The wbemcli command has been deprecated. Pywbem 1.0.0 will remove the wbemcli
  command. The recommended replacement is the pywbemcli command from the
  pywbemtools package on Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/pywbemtools/.
  Some of the reasons for the intended removal are: (See issue #1932)

  - Wbemcli does not have a command line mode (i.e. a non-interactive mode), but
    pywbemcli does.
  - The interactive mode of wbemcli is more of a programming environment than
    an interactive CLI, and that makes it harder to use than necessary.
    Pywbemcli has an interactive mode that uses the same commands as in the
    command line mode. If you need an interactive programming prompt e.g. for
    demonstrating the pywbem API, use the interactive mode of the python
    command, or Python's IDLE.
  - Pywbemcli provides more functionality than wbemcli, e.g. server commands,
    persistent connections, class find, instance count, or multiple output
    formats.

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed that the embedded_object attribute was not copied in CIMProperty.copy().

* Fixed that inconsistent names (between key and object name) were not detected
  when setting CIMMethod.parameters from an input dictionary.

* Docs: Fixed errors in description of CIMInstance.update_existing().

* Added dependency on pywin32 package for Windows, and pinned it to version 225
  to work around an issue in its version 226. (See issue ##1946)

* Modified pywbem_mock to create the instance path of new instances
  created by the compiler.  Previously, the mocker generated an exception
  if the path for a compiler created new instance was not set by the
  compiler using the instance alias. That requirement has been removed so
  the mock repository will attempt to create the path (which is required
  for the mock repository) from properties provided in the new instance.
  If any key properties of the class are not in the instance it will generate
  an exception.  This is backward compatible since the mocker will accept
  paths created by the compiler.  The incompatibility is that the mocker
  tests for the existance of all key properties. (see issue # 1958)

* Circumvented removal of Python 2.7 in Appveyor's CygWin installation
  by manually installing the python2 CygWin package. (See issue #1949)

* Fixed issue with MOFCompiler class where mof_compiler script was not writing
  the new classes and instances to the remote repository defined with the -s
  parameter. (see issue #1956 )

* Fixed issue with mof_compiler and mof rollback where instances were
  not removed when rollback was executed.  This was caused by MOFWBEMConnection
  code that did not put correct paths on the instances when they were
  inserted into the local repository so the rollback delete of the instances
  could not identify the instances. (see issue #1158)

* Fixed several install issues with the lxml, flake8, pywin32, pip, setuptools,
  and wheel packages on Python 3.8 on Windows. (See issues #1975, #1980).

**Enhancements:**

* Removed the use of the 'pbr' package because it caused too many undesirable
  side effects. As part of that, removed PKG-FILE and setup.cfg and went back
  to a simple setup.py file. (See issues #1875, #1245, #1408, #1410)

* Code: Fixed pywbem_mock issue where CreateInstance was not handling the case
  sensitivity of property cases if the instance property name case was different than the
  class property name case. While not legally incorrect the created instance
  looks bad. See issue #1883

* Code: Fixed pywbem_mock issue where ModifyInstance not handling case
  sensitivity of property cases if the instance property name case was
  different than the class property name case. Modify failed if
  the case of property names did not match. Fixed the case test error and
  put the class defined proerty name into the modified instance. See issue #1887

* Fix issue in mof compiler where mof instance that duplicates existing instance
  path can get lost with no warning. NOTE: This does not happen in the
  standalone compiler because it creates a duplicate instance issue # 1852
  but depending on the implementation of ModifyInstance for the compiler,
  it can simply lose the instance. See issue #1894

* Fix issue in pywbem_mock where instances with duplicate paths defined in mof and
  put into the mocker repository were originally accepted as separate instances
  but fixed to cause an exception in issue #1852, conform to the DMTF spec
  definition that requires that the second instance modify the first.
  Fix issue in the mof_compiler where the CreateInstance retry logic was
  first doing a ModifyInstance and if that failed then trying a DeleteInstance
  and CreateInstance.  We removed the DeleteInstance/CreateInstance logic and
  insured that an exception would occur if the ModifyInstance failed.
  See issue #1890

* Code: Fix issue with pywbem_mock that allows duplicate instances to be
  inserted into the mock repository when mof instances are compiled. Duplicate
  instances (CIMInstanceName) will now cause an exception.  See issue #1852

* Added support for byte string values in keybindings of CIMInstanceName
  method to_wbem_uri(), consistent with other methods.

* Test: Added Python 3.8 to the tested environments. (See issue #1879)

* Clarified that namespace and host will be ignored when the `ResultClass` and
  `AssocClass` parameters of association operations are specified using a
  `CIMClassName` object. (See issue #1907)

* Added capability to log calls to WBEM server from mof_compile script. AAdds
  an option to the cmd line options to enable logging.

* Added SSL related issues to the Troubleshooting section in the
  Appendix of the docs, and added the OpenSSL version to the
  `pywbem.ConnectionError` exceptions raised due to SSL errors for better
  diagnosis. (See issues #1950 and #1966)

* Added 'twine check' when uploading a version to Pypi, in order to get
  the README file checked before uploading.

**Cleanup:**

* Removed unnecessary code from cim_obj._scalar_value_tomof() that processed
  native Python types int, long, float. These types cannot occur in this
  function, so no tests could be written that test that code.


pywbem 0.14.6
-------------

Released: 2019-10-10

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed case sensitive class name check in mock support of ModifyInstance
  (See issue #1859)

* Test: Fixed args of WBEMOperation methods in mock unit tests & function tests.

**Cleanup:**

* Test: Enabled Python warning suppression for PendingDeprecationWarning
  and ResourceWarning (py3 only), and fixed incorrect make variable for that.
  (See issue #1720)

* Test: Removed pinning of testfixtures to <6.0.0 for Python 2.7/3.x due
  to deprecation issue announced for Python 3.8, and increased its minimum
  version from 4.3.3 to 6.9.0.

* Test: Increased minimum version of pytest from 3.3.0 to 4.3.1 because
  it fixed an issue that surfaced with pywbem minimum package levels
  on Python 3.7.

* Increased minimum version of PyYAML from 3.13 to 5.1 due to deprecation issue
  announced for Python 3.8.


pywbem 0.14.5
-------------

Released: 2019-09-29

**Bug fixes:**

* Added test to tests/manual/cim_operations.py specifically to test the iter and
  pull operations for the IncludeQualifier and LocalOnly parameters based on
  issue #1780.

* Dev/Test: Pinned lxml to <4.4.0 because that version removed Python 3.4
  support.

* Dev/Test: Pinned pytest to <5.0.0 for Python < 3.5 because that version
  requires Python >= 3.5.

* Test: Fixed errors on Python 2.6 about unnamed format replacements.

* Fixed incorrect format specifiers in exceptions raised in pywbem_mock.
  (See issue #1817)

* Fixed missing support for the ANY scope in pywbem_mock. (See issue #1820)

* Increased version of WinOpenSSL used on Windows from 1.1.0k to 1.1.0L.

* Fixed that the `OpenEnumerateInstances()` method of `WBEMConnections`
  incorrectly supported a `LocalOnly` parameter, that was never supported as
  per DSP0200. Specifying that parameter as `True` or `False` on this method
  caused properly implemented WBEM servers to reject the operation. That
  parameter now still exist on this operation but is ignored and is not passed
  on to WBEM servers.
  The corresponding `Iter...()` method now also ignores that parameter if the
  pull operations are used; it is still passed on if the traditional
  operations are used. (See issue #1780)

* Fixed the issue that EnumerateInstances did not return instances without
  properties unless DeepInheritance was set (see issue #1802).

* Fixed bad formatting on --mock-server option in wbemcli.py.

* Fixed the issue with 'dnf makecache fast' during pywbem_os_setup.sh on Fedora
  (See issue #1844)

**Enhancements:**

* Improved handling of missing WinOpenSSL on Windows by recommending manual
  download of next version.

* Test: Added support for running the pywbem tests against an installed version
  of pywbem, ignoring the version of pywbem that exists in the respective
  directories of the repo work directory. This is useful for testing a
  version of pywbem that has been installed as an OS-level package.
  (See issue #1803)

* Docs: Improved the section about installing to a native Windows environment
  (See issue #1804)

* Improved error messages and error handling in wbemcli and in the pywbem
  mock support.


pywbem 0.14.4
-------------

Released: 2019-07-20

**Bug fixes:**

* Test: For Python 2.6 on Travis, pinned the distro version to Ubuntu trusty
  (14.04) because the default distro version on Travis changed to xenial
  (16.04) which no longer has Python 2.6.

* Add Jupyter tutorial for pywbem_mock to table of notebooks in documentation.

* Fix issue with Python 3 and WBEMconnection certificate handling. pywbem
  was getting AttributeError: 'SSLContext' object has no attribute 'load_cert'
  because incorrect method called. (See issue # 1769)

* Fixed that the `WBEMConnection.Open...()` operations incorrectly supported
  an `IncludeQualifiers` parameter, that was never supported as per DSP0200.
  Specifying that parameter as `True` on these operations caused properly
  implemented WBEM servers to reject the operation. The parameter is now
  ignored on these operations. Since this parameter was documented as
  deprecated in DSP0200 and documented that users could not rely on qualifiers
  to be returned, this fix should not break user code. The
  `WBEMConnection.Iter...()` operations now also ignore that parameter if the
  pull operations are used, and the documentation has been updated accordingly.
  (See issue #1780)

* pywbem_mock display_repository() comment defintion that surrounds comments
  in the output was defined as # but mof comments are // so changed. (see
  issue #1951)

* Fixed that local tests (i.e. TEST_INSTALLED=False) skipped MOF tests if
  the mofparsetab or moflextab files did not exist. (See issue #1933)

**Enhancements:**

* Docs: Clarified how the pywbem_os_setup.sh/bat scripts can be downloaded
  using a predictable URL, for automated downloads.

* Clarified the 'x509' parameter of 'WBEMConnection' in that its 'key_file'
  item is optional and if omitted, both the private key and the certificate
  must be in the file referenced by the 'cert_file' item. Added checks
  for the 'x509' parameter.

**Cleanup:**

* Test: Removed pinning of distro version on Travis to Ubuntu xenial (16.04)
  for Python 3.7, because that is now the default distro version, in order to
  pick up a future increase of the default distro version automatically.


pywbem 0.14.3
-------------

Released: 2019-05-30

**Bug fixes:**

* Windows install: Upgraded version of Win32/64OpenSSL.exe that is downloaded
  during installation on native Windows, from 1.1.0j to 1.1.0k. This became
  necessary because the maintainer of the Win32OpenSSL project at
  https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html removes the previous version
  from the web site whenever a new version is released, causing the pywbem
  installation to fail during invocation of pywbem_os_setup.bat on Windows.
  Related to that, fixed the way pywbem_os_setup.bat recognizes that the
  version does not exist.
  (see issue #1754)

**Enhancements:**

* Docs: Updated the trouble shooting section with an entry that explains
  how a user can resolve the installation failure that is caused on Windows
  when the Win32OpenSSL project at
  https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html removes the previous version
  from their web site when a new version is released.

* Increased versions of the following packages to address security
  vulnerabilities:

  * requests from 2.19.1 to 2.20.1 (when on Python 2.7 or higher)
  * urllib3 from 1.22 to 1.23
  * bleach from 2.1.0 to 2.1.4

  These packages are only used for development of pywbem.

  Note that requests 2.19.1 has a security issue that is fixed in 2.20.0.
  However, requests 2.20.0 has dropped support for Python 2.6.


pywbem 0.14.2
-------------

Released: 2019-05-08

**Bug fixes:**

* Test: Temporary fix for pytest option `--pythonwarnings` in end2end tests
  (issue #1714).

* Test: Fixed AttributeError in end2end assertion functions (Issue #1714)

* Test: Added and fixed profile definitions for end2end tests. (Issue #1714)

* Fix issue in the Jupyter notebook iterablecimoperations where the
  IterQueryInstance example did not correctly processthe return from the
  operation.  It attempted to itereate the returned object and should have
  been iterating the generator property in that object.  Documentation of
  that example and the example were corrected. (see issue #1741)

* Fix issue in pywbem_mock/_wbemconnection_mock.py with EnumerateInstances that
  includes a property list with a property name that differs in case from the
  property name in the returned instance. Works in the conn_lite=True mode but
  fails in conn_lite=False mode because the test was case insensitive.

* Test: Fixed Appveyor CI setup for UNIX-like environments under Windows
  (Issue #1729)

**Enhancements:**

* Changed GetCentralInstances methodology in WBEMServer.get_central_instances()
  to be bypassed by default, because (1) WBEM servers do not implement it at
  this point, and (2) there are WBEM servers that do not behave gracefully
  when unknown CIM methods are invoked. Because WBEM servers are required to
  implement one of the other methodologies, this change is not incompatible for
  pywbem users.

* Improved the performance for receiving large CIM-XML responses in the
  tupleparser by moving type checks for text content in XML into an error
  handling path, and by replacing some isinstance() calls with type()
  comparison.

* Improved the quality of the information in TypeError exceptions that are raised
  due to invalid types passed in WBEMConnection operation arguments. (Issue #1736)


pywbem 0.14.1
-------------

Released: 2019-04-05

**Bug fixes:**

* Change history: Removed incorrect statement about commenting out
  server-specific functionality from the tuple parser from the change history
  of pywbem 0.14.0.


pywbem 0.14.0
-------------

This version contains all fixes up to pywbem 0.13.1.

Released: 2019-04-03

**Bug fixes:**

* Extend makefile clobber to remove cover files from pywbem_mock package.

* Fixed pip version issue on Appveyor.

* Fixed AttributeError on __offset in CIMDateTime.repr(). See issue #1681.

* Removed the associationDeclaration and IndicationDeclaration mof parser
  production rules from mof_compiler.py because: a) They were orderd in
  p_mp_createClass so that the classDeclaration production was always used,
  b) When reordered, they still created a YACC reduce/reduce conflict where the
  result was that YACC used the classDeclaration production to resolve the
  conflict, c) they represent exactly the same syntax as the classDeclaration.
  In effect, these production rules were never really used executed.

**Enhancements:**

* Significant performance improvements in the CIM-XML parser, resulting in
  about 50% elapsed time savings for 10000 returned CIM instances, compared
  to pywbem 0.13.0. See issue #1630.

* Added the possibility to specify a value of `False` for the `embedded_object`
  attribute/parameter of `CIMProperty` and `CIMParameter`. It is stored as
  `None`. The only difference to specifying `None` is that the
  `embedded_object` value is not inferred from the property or parameter value
  in that case, so this saves performance.

* Added the 'python_requires' keyword to the package definition, which makes pip
  aware of the supported Python versions.

* Refactored and extended Jupyter notebook for pywbem_mock.


pywbem 0.13.0
-------------

Released: 2019-02-23

This version contains all fixes up to pywbem 0.12.6.

**Incompatible changes:**

* Changed the `path` argument of `CIMInstance` to be deep copied, because it
  may be modified by setting properties. It was previously shallow copied
  (and incorrectly documented as not being copied). This is only incompatible
  if user code relies on the init method modifying the keybindings of its
  `path` input argument. If user code relies on that, it is highly recommended
  that you decouple such dependencies (Issue #1251).

* Changed the `path` argument of `CIMClass` to be shallow copied, in order
  to decouple the created object from its input arguments. It was previously
  not copied but referenced. This is only incompatible if user code relies on
  the init method modifying the provided `path` input argument. If user code
  relies on that, it is highly recommended that you decouple such
  dependencies (Issue #1251).

* Changed keybinding processing when creating `CINInstanceName` objects to
  disallow NULL keybinding values. This is in accord with the CIM standard
  DSP0004.
  This is only incompatible if user code relies on the non-standard
  behavior of creating a keybinding having `None` as a value.
  If your code relies on that non-standard behavior, it can be
  re-established by via the config property `IGNORE_NULL_KEY_VALUE` in
  config.py. Note that NULL keybindings may be an issue with some WBEM
  servers. (Issue #1298)

* The fix for issue #1302 removed the pywbem config variables from the
  `pywbem` namespace. They are now only available via the `pywbem.config`
  namespace. However, this change should not affect you because the
  previously documented approach for changing them through the `pywbem`
  namespace did not work, so if you changed the config variables
  successfully, you have done that through the `pywbem.config` namespace
  already, and this change does not affect you.

* Removed the `ez_setup.py` script from the repository. That script is the
  well-known tool that bootstraps `easy_setup` which was used for installing
  Python packages in times before `pip` became ubiquitous. If anyone still
  uses `easy_setup` these days for installing Python packages, it is time
  to switch to using `pip`. If you cannot do that for some reason, you will
  now need to install `easy_setup` by some other means.

* Changed `CIMError` exceptions raised to indicate incorrect CIM-XML responses
  to open/pull operations, to raise `ParseError` instead, consistent with
  other response checking (Issue #1320).

**Deprecations:**

* Added announcement that Python 2.6 support in pywbem will be removed in
  its future 1.0.0 version.

* Deprecated the `tocimobj()` function because it has some inconsistencies,
  in favor of the `cimvalue()` function introduced in pywbem 0.12.0. Changed
  all internal uses of `tocimobj()` to `cimvalue()`. (Issue #904).

* The deprecated internal methods `imethodcall()` and `methodcall()` of the
  `WBEMConnection` class will be removed in the next pywbem version after
  0.13.

* Removed the deprecation for setting the `default_namespace` attribute
  of `WBEMConnection` that had been introduced in pywbem 0.12; setting it
  is now fully supported again.

**Finalizations:**

* Finalized the `use_pull_operations` property and init argument of the
  `WBEMConnections` class that allows controlling whether the `Iter...()`
  methods use pull operations or traditional operations.

* Finalized the logging support. The logging support was introduced in
  pywbem 0.11 and was redesigned in pywbem 0.12. For details, see the
  "WBEM operation logging" section in the pywbem documentation.

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed the issue where wbemcli-help-txt was not being updated when wbemcli.py
  changed. (Issue #1205)

* Test: Fixed access to incorrect tuple members in run_cim_operations.py.
  that were used only in long version of the test. Found by Pylint.
  (Issue #1206).

* Fixed that `CIMInstanceName.from_wbem_uri()` did not support the
  representation of integer key values in binary, octal or hex format
  (part of Issue #904).

* Fixed an issue with running the tests on Travis CI that occurred on
  Python 2.6 with the latest package level and that was caused by the fact
  that a new version of the "httpretty" Python package was released that
  had dropped support for Python 2.6. This was fixed by limiting the
  version of httpretty to <0.9 when running on Python 2.6. Note that
  this only affects the development environment.

* Correct issue in pywbem_mock where we return incorrect CIMError
  (CIM_ERR_NOT_FOUND rather than CIM_ERR_METHOD_NOT_FOUND) when the
  class for a method is not defined in the methods repository. issue #1256

* Fixed issue in pywbem_mock where we were not creating deepcopy (we were using
  the pywbem .copy that is part of each object (see issue #1251) of objects
  returned from the repository so that if the objects were modified some of the
  changes bled back into the repository. Code modified to do deepcopy of
  everything inserted into the repository through add_cimobjects and the
  Create... methods and returned from the repository with any of the
  get/enumerate/etc. methods.  We also modified code so that if there is a
  class repository there is also an instance repository even if it
  is empty. See issue #1253

* Fixed issue where pywbem_mock EnumerateClass and EnumerateClassNames
  parameter losing the ClassName parameter and no test for the ClassName
  parameter not existing in the repository. (See issue #1271)

* Correct issue in pywbem_mock where we return incorrect CIMError
  (CIM_ERR_NOT_FOUND rather than CIM_ERR_METHOD_NOT_FOUND) when the
  class for a method is not defined in the methods repository. issue #1256

* Fix issue causing pywbem_mock/_wbemconnection_mock.py display_repository()
  to display as bytes in Python 3.  See issue # 1276

* Fixed the support for Unicode escape sequences in the MOF compiler. It
  supported only lower case `\x1234` but not upper case `\X1234`.
  Also, it tolerated an invalid `\x` escape sequence, when DSP0004 requires
  1..4 hex characters to be present.
  See issue #1278.

* Fixed issue where Null key values allowed. See issue #1298

* Fixed issue with updating pywbem config variables.
  So far, the pywbem config variables were defined in the `pywbem.config`
  namespace and then imported by pywbem into the `pywbem` namespace.
  Pywbem documented that these config variables should be accessed (read
  and written) through the `pywbem` namespace. However, pywbem code
  read them in nearly all cases from the `pywbem.config` namespace.
  This caused an update that is done by a pywbem user through the `pywbem`
  namespace, not to be visible in the `pywbem.config` namespace, so pywbem
  did not react to the user's change.
  This was fixed by only using the `pywbem.config` namespace for config
  variables. They are no longer imported into the `pywbem` namespace.
  See issue #1302.

* Fixed issue where the `tomof()` methods of `CIMProperty`, `CIMQualifier`,
  and `CIMQualifierDeclaration` raised `IndexError` when the value was
  an empty array. This issue perculated up to higher level CIM objects
  that are using these objects, i.e. `CIMInstance` or `CIMClass`.
  Added according testcases.
  See issue #1312.

* Fix issue in IterQueryInstances where the QueryLanguage and Query parameters
  were reveresed in the fallback call to ExecQuery method. See issue # 1334.

* Fixed the issue that the VALUE.OBJECTWITHLOCALPATH element was not allowed
  as a child element under IRETURNVALUE. This element is used as one
  possibility for the result of the ExecQuery operation.
  See issue #1347.

* Fixed issue in run_cimoperations.py with test for deep inheritance on
  EnumerateInstances. It was reporting confused result so we created a simpler
  test. See issue #477.

* Fixed issues in pywbem_mock where classnames on the operation requests were
  not treated as case insensitive for some operations, in particular the
  enumerate operations, reference operations, and associator operations. This
  also adds a number of tests to validate that classnames. See issue #1355.

* Fixed the issue that INSTANCE child elements on a returned ERROR element
  were not allowed. INSTANCE child elements are now allowed and will appear
  to the user as a list of `CIMInstance` objects in a new `instances` property
  of the `CIMError` exception that is raised. See issue #1380.

* Fixed issue in mof_compiler search_paths where doc defined iterable as
  input but since string is an interable it was allowed but misused. Extended
  code to specifically allow single string on input. See issue #1227.

* Increased the minimum required versions of the following dependent Python
  packages in order to fix security issues with these packages:

  - requests from 2.12.4 to 2.19.1
  - html5lib from 0.9999999 to 0.999999999
  - mistune from 0.7.3 to 0.8.1

* The `ValueMapping` class only supported decimal representations of integer
  values in the `ValueMap` qualifier. However, DSP0004 allows for decimal,
  binary, octal and hexadecimal representations of integer values. Added support
  for all these representations to the `ValueMapping` class.
  See issue #1547.

* Multiple fixes in `WBEMServer.get_central_instances()`:

  - For a profile that implements the central class methodology but has no
    central instances, the implementation went on to try the scoping class
    methodology. Now, it accepts that as a valid central instance implementation
    and returns an empty list of instances, instead.
    Non-implementation of the central class methodology is not detected
    from CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED being returned on the Associators operation
    that attempts to traverse the CIM_ElementConformsToProfile association.

  - For a profile that implements the scoping class methodology, the
    traversal from the profile side to the resource side incorrectly
    assumed that for multi-hop scoping paths, the hops above the first hop
    could be used as the scoping path of the scoping profile. That has
    been changed to now omit the scoping path when invoking
    `get_central_instances()` on the scoping profile. As a result, the
    scoping profile is now required to implement the central class
    methodology.

  - For a profile that implements the scoping class methodology, the
    traversal from the central instances of the scoping profile down
    to the central instances of the original profile incorrectly only
    traversed the first hop of the reversed scoping path. This has been
    fixed to traverse the entire reversed scoping path.

  - In the recursive invocation of `get_central_instances()` for the scoping
    profile, the newly introduced reference direction was not passed on.
    For now, it is assumed that the scoping profile has the same
    reference direction as the original profile.

  - Because it seems that with these bugs, the `get_central_instances()`
    method cannot have been used reasonably, some `ValueError` exceptions`
    it returned to indicate server implementation issues, have been
    changed to use the newly introduced `ModelError` exception.

* For Python 2.6, pinned version of lxml to <4.3.0, because lxml 4.3.0 has
  removed support for Python 2.6. See issue #1592.

* Fixed the URL on the DMTF site from which the MOF archive is downloaded.
  This has changed on the DMTF site and needed to be adjusted.

* Fixed order of parameters in example method_callback_interface defined in
  pywbem_mock FakedWBEMConnection. (See issue #1614)

* Fixed an error "Python : can't open file 'C:\Users\firstname' :
  No such file or directory" when invoking wbemcli.bat on native Windows
  in a directory whose path name contained blanks. (See issue #1622)

* Extend pywbem_mock to correctly handle resolving of classes when they are
  inserted into the repository.  Resolving of classes configures a class
  inserted with CreateClass or through the mocker add_cimobjects, etc. to
  reflect the inheritance of properties, methods, etc. from the superclass.
  The initial release did a very abbreviated resolution which left some
  characteristics of the new class and did not properly handle things like
  the override qualifier. (See issue # 1540). This change also simplifies
  the mocker in that both the compiler and the mock responder methods
  contribute to the same repository (the original version copied objects
  from the compiler repository to the mocker repository).

* Test: Fixed a bytes/unicode error in validate.py that occurred on Python 3
  when xmllint failed validating the DTD.

* Increased the minimum M2Crypto version to 0.31.0 in order to pick
  up the fix for pywbem issue #1275 (incorrect timeout value).

* Added the Pyton `tox` package to the dependencies for development.

**Enhancements:**

* Extend pywbem MOF compiler to search for dependent classes including:

  a) reference classes (classes defined in reference properties or parameters)

  b) EmbeddedInstance qualifier classes if they are not compiled before the
     classes that reference them are compiled. Previously the lack of these
     dependent classes was ignored.  The compiler already searches for
     superclasses if they are not compiled before their subclasses.

  Extends MOFWBEMConnection to generate an exception if the compile of a
  class with reference parameters or properties reference class is not in the
  repository or if the class defined for an EmbeddedInstance qualifier is
  not in the repository.

  This uses the capability in the MOF compiler to search the defined
  search path for the missing classes if they are not in the repository.

  This means that the mof_compiler can be used to create a complete class
  repository builds without having to  specifically declare all dependent
  classes for the classes the user needs in a repository if the mof for the
  dependent classes in in the search path. (Issue #1160).

* Made `CIMInstanceName.from_wbem_uri()` and `CIMClassName.from_wbem_uri()`
  more flexible w.r.t. tolerating non-standard WBEM URIs that omit the leading
  colon before class names (part of Issue #904).

* Added a `tobinary()` method to the `ValueMapping` class, which translates the
  value mapping from a `Values` string to binary integer values, or a range
  thereof. This is the opposite direction of the existing `tovalues()` method.
  (Issue #1153)

* Added an `items()` generator method to the `ValueMapping` class for iterating
  through the items of the value mapping, returning tuples of the binary value
  (or a range thereof), and the `Values` string. (Issue #1153)

* Docs: Clarified that the `copy()` methods of `NocaseDict` and of the CIM object
  classes produce middle-deep copies, whereby mutable leaf attributes are not
  copied and thus are shared between original and copy (Issue #1251).

* Docs: Added a note to the description of the `copy()` methods of the CIM
  objects that states that `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()` can be used
  to create completely shallow or completely deep copies (Issue #1251).

* Extend wbemcli to use pywbem_mock with a new command line parameter
  (--mock_server <mock_info-filename>). Added a set of new tests for this
  parameter and a MOF file and test code to test the new option.
  (Issue #1268)

* Installation on Windows is now more automated by means of a new
  `pywbem_os_setup.bat` script. As part of that, the latest `M2Crypto` version
  0.30.1 is now used on Windows, and no longer the somewhat aged versions in
  the `M2CryptoWin32/64` packages. For details, see the installation section
  in the documentation. That script also downloads and installs Win32 OpenSSL
  from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.

* Made exception messages more explicit in the ValueMapping and WBEMServer
  classes. Issue #1281.

* Docs: Added a shell command for determining the version of an installed
  pywbem package, that covers all released pywbem versions (Issue #1246).

* Docs: Added jupyter notebooks to demonstrate use of pywbem_mock.

* Make: Eliminated the confusing but unproblematic error message about
  pbr importing when running certain make targets in a freshly created
  Python environment. Issue #1288.

* In `MOFCompiler.__init__()`, added a type check for the search_paths parameter
  to avoid accidential passing of a single string. Issue #1292.

* Add new static method to CIMInstance (from_class) that builds an
  instance from a class and dictionary of property values. Issue #1188

* Added support for tolerating a `TYPE` attribute in the `PARAMVALUE` element
  of received CIM-XML responses. The `TYPE` attribute is not allowed as
  per DSP0201. However, there are devices that have incorrectly implemented
  a `TYPE` attribute instead of the standard `PARAMTYPE` attribute.
  The `TYPE` attribute when present is now used when `PARAMTYPE` is not
  present. If both are present, `PARAMTYPE` is used and `TYPE` is ignored.
  Also, test cases were added for tupleparse for the `PARAMVALUE` element.
  See issue #1241.

* Added support for automatically creating the `Pragma: UpdateExpiredPassword`
  HTTP header in the CIM-XML request if pywbem detects that the special SFCB
  method "UpdateExpiredPassword()" is invoked on class "SFCB_Account". SFCB
  requires this HTTP header for that method.
  See https://sblim.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/SfcbExpiredPasswordUpdate for
  details about this SFCB functionality.
  The automatic creation of the header field is enabled by default and can be
  disabled with a new pywbem config variable `AUTO_GENERATE_SFCB_UEP_HEADER`.
  See issue #1326.

* Add support for ExecQuery (shortcut eqy) to wbemcli. See issue # 1332.

* Added support for a new WBEM URI format "canonical" to the `to_wbem_uri()`
  methods of `CIMInstanceName` and `CIMClassName`. The new format behaves
  like the existing format "standard", except that case insensitive
  components are translated to lower case, and the order of keybindings
  is the lexical order of the lower-cased key names. The new format
  guarantees that two instance paths or class paths that are equal
  according to DSP0004, return equal WBEM URI strings.
  See issue #1323.

* Added support for Python 3.7, which was released 2018-06-27.

* Enhanced the output of the string representation of the `CIMError`
  exception by adding the status code name (e.g. the string
  "CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED" for status code 7). The string representation
  is used for example when showing the exception in a Python traceback.
  See issue #1350.

* Added checking for the returned instance name to the CreateInstance
  operation. This changes the exception that is raised from `TypeError` or
  `IndexError` indicating an internal issue, to several `pywbem.ParseError`
  exceptions that have reasonable error messages.
  Note that there is an uncertainty as to whether DSP0200 would allow
  CreateInstance to not return an instance name. Because this would already
  have caused an exception to be raised in the current pywbem code, it is
  assumed that all WBEM server implementations so far always return the
  instance name, and therefore, pywbem has just improved the quality of the
  exception that is raised, and continues not to tolerate a missing instance
  name.
  Extended the testcases for CreateInstance accordingly.
  See issue #1319.

* Added support for CIM namespace creation via a new
  `WBEMServer.create_namespace()` method. See issue #29.

* Added support for CIM namespace deletion via a new
  `WBEMServer.delete_namespace()` method. See issue #1356.

* Added connection information to all pywbem exceptions. This is done via a
  new optional `conn_id` keyword argument that was added to all pywbem
  exception classes. The exception message now has a connection information
  string at its end. See issue #1155.

* Added support for passing a `WBEMConnection` object for the handle
  parameter of the `MOFCompiler` creation. This allows a user to pass
  the WBEM connection directly as a CIM repository, without first having
  to create a MOFWBEMConnection object.

* Made the namespace handling in the pywbem mock support explicit. It is now
  required to add any namespaces to the mock registry in a `FakedWBEMConnection`
  object. A method `add_namespace()` has been added for easy setup of the
  mock repository w.r.t. namespaces. The default namespace of the connection is
  added automatically when creating a `FakedWBEMConnection` object.

  Extended the support for handling namespace creation in the faked
  CreateInstance operation to support `CIM_Namespace` in addition to
  `PG_Namespace`, and improved it to properly reflect the created namespace
  in the mock repository.

  Added support for handling namespace deletion in the faked DeleteInstance
  operation for creation classes `CIM_Namespace` and `PG_Namespace`.

* Added support for asterisks in CIM datetime values to the `pywbem.CIMDateTime`
  class, as defined in DSP0004 for representing insignificant digits. Changed
  the format returned by its `__repr()__` method so that it now shows its
  internal attributes and no longer the string representation of the value.
  Added a `__repr__()` method to the `pywbem.MinutesFromUTC` class that shows
  its internal attributes. See issue #1379.

* Added an `instances` property to the `CIMError` exception class that can
  be used to represent a list of error instances returned by the WBEM server
  in error responses. See issue #1380.

* Pywbem now ensures that when specifying the `default_namespace` argument
  of `WBEMConnection()` as `None`, or when setting the `default_namespace`
  attribute of an already existing `WBEMConnection` object to `None`, that it
  is set to the built-in default namespace "root/cimv2", instead. Previously,
  that was done only when not specifying the `default_namespace` argument.

* All exception and warning messages produced by pywbem now are guaranteed to
  contain only ASCII characters. Unicode characters in the messages are
  represented using an escape syntax such as `\\uXXXX` or `\\U00XXXXXX`.
  That was also done for the result of any `__repr__()` methods of pywbem.
  This is important in order to avoid secondary Unicode encoding exceptions
  while a first exception or warning is processed. See issue #1072.

* Docs: Added summary tables for public methods and public attributes exposed
  by classes defined by the "pywbem" and "pywbem_mock" Python packages,
  including any methods and attributes inherited from base classes.
  See issue #1417.

* Improved the `brand` and `version` attributes of the `WBEMServer` class
  so that they produce reasonable results for more types of WBEM servers
  than just OpenPegasus and SFCB. The WBEM servers that are now recognized,
  are:

    * ``"OpenPegasus"``
    * ``"SFCB"`` (Small Footprint CIM Broker)
    * ``"WBEM Solutions J WBEM Server"``
    * ``"EMC CIM Server"``
    * ``"FUJITSU CIM Object Manager"``

  See issue #1422.

* Added `__str__()` methods to the `WBEMServer`, `WBEMListener`, and
  `WBEMSubscriptionManager` classes in order to reduce the amount of
  information. Previously, this defaulted to the result of `__repr__()`.
  See issue #1424.

* Improved the quality of any `ParseError` exception messages when the SAX
  parser detects errors in CIM-XML responses. See issue #1438.

* Added a `ToleratedServerIssueWarning` class and its base class `Warning`.
  The new `ToleratedServerIssueWarning` is raised in cases when the WBEM server
  exhibits some incorrect behavior that is tolerated by pywbem.

* Added a `ModelError` exception class that indicates an error with the model
  implemented by the WBEM server, that was detected by the pywbem client.

* Added support for tolerating ill-formed XML in the CIM-XML response returned
  by the server from the attempt to invoke the CIM method GetCentralInstances()
  inside of `WBEMServer.get_central_instances()`. One server was found to
  return such ill-formed XML. This now causes pywbem to issue a
  `ToleratedServerIssueWarning` and to continue with the next approach for
  determining the central instances. See issue #1438.

* The `last_raw_request` and `last_raw_reply` properties of `WBEMConnection`
  had previously only been set when debug was enabled on the connection.
  They are now always set. This was needed to support tolerating ill-formed
  XML, and does not cost any additional conversions.
  See issues #1438 and #1568.

* In the `WBEMServer` class, the Interop namespace is now added to the set
  of namespaces in the `namespaces`  property, if missing there. This
  accomodates the behavior of a particular WBEM server that was found to
  support the Interop namespace without representing it as a CIM instance.
  See issue #1430.

* Added support for specifying the reference direction in
  `WBEMServer.get_central_instances()` by adding an optional parameter
  `reference_direction`. This was necessary because the DMTF 'Profile
  Registration Profile' (PRP) and the SNIA PRP use the CIM_ReferencedProfile
  association class in opposite ways: The DMTF PRP defines that the
  'Dependent' end of that class goes to the referencing profile which
  is defined to be the autonomous profile, while the SNIA PRP defines that
  the 'Antecedent' end goes to the autonomous profile.
  See issue #1411.

* In order to be able to distinguish errors at the CIM-XML level (e.g.
  required attribute missing on an XML element) and at the XML level
  (e.g. ill-formed XML), two subclasses of the `ParseError` exception
  have been added: `CIMXMLParseError` and `XMLParseError`, that are
  now raised instead of `ParseError`. Because these are subclasses,
  this change is backwards compatible for users that have caught
  `ParseError`. The new subclasses have the CIM-XML request and
  response data available as properties.

* The `WBEMServer.get_selected_profiles()` method has been changed to
  match the registered names, organisations and versions of profiles
  case insensitively, in order to better deal with profile name changes
  in SMI-S. See issue #1551.

* Docs: Clarified in the WBEMServer.get_central_instances() method that
  all profiles scoped by a top-level specification or autonomous profile
  implement the same reference direction ('snia' or 'dmtf').

* Docs: The WBEMServer.get_central_instances() method had a description
  of the profile advertisement methodologies that was hard to understand
  without knowledge of some of the related DMTF standards. Changed that
  to make it understandable for pywbem users without requiring knowledge
  of these documents. Some of the text has been moved to a new section
  "Profile advertisement methodologies" in the Appendix of the pywbem
  documentation. As part of that, clarified how to determine the scoping
  class and scoping path for a component profile that does not specify
  them in the profile description. See issue #1398.

* Corrected the hint how to exit in wbemcli when running on Windows.

* Added method to statistics (class Statistics, method reset()) to reset
  the statistics on a WBEMConnection. This simply resets all of the statistics
  values gathered on that connection to their initial values.

**Cleanup:**

* Moved class `NocaseDict` into its own module (Issue #848).

* Resolved several Pylint issues, including several fixes (Issue #1206).

* Cleanup mof_compiler use of args[0] and args[1] with CIMError. (Issue #1221)

* Removed one level of superflous copies of dictionaries in the `copy()`
  methods of the CIM object classes. These dictionaries are already copied
  in the setter methods for the respective attributes (Issue #1251).

* Added and improved CIM-XML response checks at operation level (Issue #919).

* Changed some warnings classified as `UserWarning` to be classified as
  `pywbem.ToleratedServerIssueWarning`, because that better fits the nature
  of the warnings. See issue #1595.

* Removed the Connection ID from any exception and warning messages, so that
  Python warnings about the same thing are now properly folded together into
  one warning during end2end tests. The exception objects still contain
  the connection ID as a property `conn_id`, and the pywbem log also still
  shows the connection ID for each entry. See issue #1589.

**Build, test, quality:**

* Add tests for the `WBEMSubscriptionManager` class using the pywbem mock
  support.  This involved
  changing the tests for the `WBEMServer` class using pywbem_mock because the
  WBEMSubscriptionManager class depends on the existence of the classes and
  instances that support the pywbem WbemServer class existing in the WBEM
  server.  A new file (wbemserver_mock.py) was added to the tests
  that creates the pywbem_mock for any tests that depend on classes like
  CIM_Namespace, CIM_ObjectManager existing in the mocked server. See issue
  #1250

* Needed to upgrade PyYAML version from >=3.12 to >=3.13 due to an issue
  in PyYAML on Python 3.7, that was fixed in PyYAML 3.13.
  See issue #1337.

* Pinned the version of the pytest-cov package to <2.6 due to the fact that
  pytest-cov 2.6.0 has increased its version requirement for the coverage
  package from coverage>=3.7.1 to coverage>=4.4. That is in conflict with
  the version requirement of python-coveralls for coverage==4.0.3.
  This is only a workaround; An issue against python-coveralls has been
  opened: https://github.com/z4r/python-coveralls/issues/66

* Reorganized the `testsuite` directory to better separate unit tests,
  function tests, end2end tests, and the tested areas (pywbem, pywbem_mock, and
  test utility functions). The new top level test directory is now named
  `tests` and the new directrory structure is documented in section
  "Testing" in the development section of the pywbem documentation and in the
  file `tests/README`.

* Added the concept of end2end tests for pywbem.
  The end2end tests execute test files named `test_*.py` within the
  `tests/end2endtest` directory against groups of real WBEM servers defined
  by a WBEM server definition file in YAML syntax:
  `tests/server_definitions/server_definition_file.yml`.
  There is an example file `example_server_definition_file.yml`.
  There are some initial tests, and users can define their own tests.

* For the end2end tests, added a file `tests/profiles/profiles.yml` that
  defines the discovery-related characteristics of a number of DMTF and SNIA
  management profiles, and that is used to drive profile discovery related
  tests against WBEM servers.

* Added toleration support in the CIM-XML response parsing for WBEM servers
  that return attribute `TYPE` with an empty string instead of omitting it.
  As part of that, improved the checking for valid values of the TYPE
  attribute. See issue #1564.

* Improved testing of the `tocimxml()` and `tocimxmlstr()` methods of the CIM
  object classes (e.g. `CIMinstance`) by adding validation against the CIM-XML
  DTD, and by adding tests for the `indent` parameter of `tocimxmlstr()`.

* Added support for running pylint also on Python 3.x. See issue #1640.

* Improved the makefile for use on native Windows. See issue #1631. Details:

  - Some GNU make versions on native Windows have an issue with double
    quotes in make $(shell ..) commands; removed the use of double quotes.
    As a result, most inline python commands have been moved into new small
    scripts in the tools directory.
    Also, several make targets that used to produce log files,
    no longer can do that and the user needs to redirect the make invocation
    in order to get a log file.

  - Removed dependencies on most UNIX-like commands (touch, tee, bash, rm,
    find, xargs) when using make on native Windows.

  - Encapsulated file removal and copy commands to be compatible between
    native Windows and other platforms.

  - Updated the appveyor.yml file to check only the new, smaller, list of
    commands.


pywbem 0.12.0
-------------

Released: 2018-04-11

**Incompatible changes:**

* Finalized the Iter support that was experimental so far. This affects the
  `Iter...()` methods of class `WBEMConnection`, the `use_pull_operations`
  init parameter and instance attribute of class `WBEMConnection`, and the
  iter-related shortcuts in the `wbemcli` script.

* The following initialization parameters of some CIM object classes that are
  required not to be `None` (as per the documentation) are now enforced not to
  be `None`, and `ValueError` is now raised when providing them as `None`:

  - `CIMInstanceName.classname` (already raised `ValueError`)
  - `CIMInstance.classname`
  - `CIMClassName.classname` (previously raised `TypeError`)
  - `CIMClass.classname`
  - `CIMProperty.name` (already raised `ValueError`)
  - `CIMMethod.name` (previously raised `TypeError`)
  - `CIMParameter.name`
  - `CIMParameter.type`
  - `CIMQualifier.name`
  - `CIMQualifierDeclaration.name`
  - `CIMQualifierDeclaration.type`

  Unless otherwise noted, the previous behavior was to tolerate `None`.

  Note that in all cases, the requirement not to be `None` had previously been
  documented.

* When setting some attributes of CIM object classes that are required not to
  be `None` (as per the documentation), `ValueError` is now raised when
  attempting to set them to `None`:

  - `CIMInstanceName.classname`
  - `CIMInstance.classname`
  - `CIMClassName.classname`
  - `CIMClass.classname`
  - `CIMProperty.name`
  - `CIMMethod.name`
  - `CIMParameter.name`
  - `CIMParameter.type`
  - `CIMQualifier.name`
  - `CIMQualifierDeclaration.name`
  - `CIMQualifierDeclaration.type`

  The previous behavior was to tolerate `None`.

  Note that in all cases, the requirement not to be `None` had previously been
  documented.

* When initializing objects of the CIM object classes `CIMProperty` and
  `CIMQualifier` with a `type` parameter of `None`, and when initializing
  the properties of `CIMInstance`, their CIM type is (and has previously been)
  inferred from the value.

  If inferring the type is not possible (for example because the value is a
  Python integer, float, long (Python 2 only), or `None`), the exception that
  is raised is now `ValueError`. Previously, `TypeError` was raised in that
  case.

* When setting the `type` attribute of the CIM object classes `CIMProperty` and
  `CIMQualifier`, the type is now enforced not to be `None`, and `ValueError`
  is raised when providing it as `None`.

  Previously, setting a type of `None` was tolerated.

  Note that in both cases, the requirement not to be `None` had previously been
  documented.

* For CIM elements passed as dictionaries into CIM object classes (i.e.
  the aparameters/attributes `properties`, `keybindings`, `parameters`,
  `qualifiers`), the consistency between the dictionary key and the name of the
  CIM object that is the dictionary value is now checked and `ValueError` is
  raised if it does not match (case insensitively).

* Initializing a `CIMProperty` object as an embedded object or embedded
  instance and with a value of `None` now requires specifying `type="string"`.

  Previously (but only starting with pywbem 0.8.1), the type was inferred from
  the `embedded_instance` parameter and thus could be omitted. This new
  requirement for specifying `type` is not really intentional, but a by-product
  of simplifying the implementation of `CIMProperty`. It was considered
  acceptable because that should not be a common case (and has not been
  supported before pywbem 0.8.1 anyway).

* When converting a `CIMInstance` object to CIM-XML using its `tocimxml()`
  method, instance properties whose values are simple types instead of
  `CIMProperty` objects are no longer converted into `CIMProperty` objects
  because that has worked only for a very limited set of cases, and
  because they are required to be `CIMProperty` objects anyway. A `TypeError`
  is now raised if that is detected.

* The `atomic_to_cim_xml()` function now raises `TypeError` if it cannot
  convert the input value. Previously, it used `str()` on the input value
  as a last resort.

* The global `tocimxml()` function now raises `TypeError` if it cannot
  convert the input value. Previously, it raised `ValueError`.

* The `CIMQualifierDeclaration.tomof()` method now generates the flavor
  keywords only if the `tosubclass` and `overridable` attributes are set
  to `True` or `False`. Previously, default keywords were generated when
  these attributes were set to `None` (and these defaults were the opposite of
  the defaults defined in DSP0004 and DSP0201). The new behavior is consistent
  with the definition that `None` for these attributes means the information is
  not available, and it is also consistent with the `tocimxml()` method.
  If you used this method and relied on the defaults being generated, you will
  now have to set these attributes explicitly.

* If a WBEM server specifies contradicting `TYPE` and `VALUETYPE` attributes on
  a `KEYVALUE` element returned to the client (this element is used in instance
  paths, e.g. for the result of the `EnumerateInstanceNames` operation), `TYPE`
  now takes precedence. Previously, `VALUETYPE` took precedence. DSP0201 leaves
  the handling of such discrepancies open, and it seems more logical to let the
  more precise value take precedence. Because WBEM servers are required to
  specify consistent values for these attributes, this change should not affect
  users of pywbem.

* Values of CIM type 'reference' in CIM objects (`CIMProperty`,
  `CIMParameter`, `CIMQualifier`, and `CIMQualifierDeclaration`) may now be
  `CIMClassName` objects (i.e. class paths). This has been changed for
  consistency with DSP0201 (Issue #1035).

* Renamed the `enable_stats` init argument of class `WBEMConnection` to
  `stats_enabled`, as part of its finalization. It was experimental, before.
  (Issue #1068).

* Renamed the `-e`, `--enable-stats` options of the `wbemcli` utility to
  `--statistics` , as part of its finalization. It was experimental, before.
  (Issue #1068).

* Changed the `WBEMConnection` attributes for the last request and last
  response to become read-only (`last_request`, `last_raw_request`,
  `last_reply`, `last_raw_reply`). They have never been supposed to be
  writeable by users. (Issue #1068).

* In the wbemcli shell, renamed the following function parameters. This
  is only relevant if you wrote scripts against the shell and named these
  parameters: (Issue #1110).

  - The "op" parameter of iter functions that have it was renamed to "ip",
    because it is always an instance path.

  - The "qi" parameter of the query functions was renamed to "qs",
    for consistency with the filtering functions.

  - The "fq" parameter of the filtering functions was renamed to "fs",
    for consistency with the query functions.

* Revamped the (experimental) logger configuration mechanism completely.
  It remains experimental. See issue #859. The changes include:

  - Created 3 methods in `WBEMConnection` that allow pywbem logs to be
    configured and activated.  These methods contain parameters for:
    a. configuring the Python loggers for either/or/both the api and http
    loggers. b. Setting the level of detail in the log output. c. Activating
    each logger within `WBEMConnection`.
  - Allow for the standard Python loggers to be used to configure logger
    names that will be used by the pywbem loggers. This allows the pywbem
    loggers to be compatible with user code that creates their specific logger
    configurations.
  - Eliminated the `PyWBEMLogger` class that was the original
    logging setup tool in pywbem 0.11.0 since its use was incompatible with
    using standard Python logging configuration methods to define loggers.
  - Created a function in the _logging module that allows pywbem logging
    to be defined by a single string input.
  - Addition of a new property `conn_id` to `WBEMConnection` which is a
    unique identifier for each `WBEMConnection` object and is part of each log
    record. This allows linking logs for each `WBEMConnection` in the log.

**Deprecations:**

* Deprecated modifications of the connection-related attributes of
  `WBEMConnection` objects (Issue #1068).

* Deprecated the value `None` for the `value` argument of
  `pywbem.tocimxml()`, because it generates an empty `VALUE` element
  (which represents an empty string) (Issue #1136).

**Enhancements:**

* Finalized the time statistics support that was experimental so far. This
  affects classes `OperationStatistic`, `Statistics`, the init argument
  `enable_stats` of class `WBEMConnection`, and the properties
  `stats_enabled`, `statistics`, `last_operation_time`, and
  `last_server_response_time` of class `WBEMConnection`. As part of that,
  renamed the `enable_stats` init argument to `stats_enabled`, consistent with
  the corresponding property.

* For `CIMInstanceName`, the values of keybindings can now be specified as
  `CIMProperty` objects from which their value will be used (this is in
  addition to specfying the values of keybindings as CIM data types).

* For `CIMInstanceName`, values of keybindings specified as binary strings are
  now converted to Unicode.

* For `CIMInstanceName`, the type of the input keybindings is now checked
  and TypeError is raised if the value is not a CIM data type.

* Updating attributes of CIM objects (e.g. updating `CIMInstance.properties`)
  now goes through the same conversions (e.g. binary string to unicode string)
  as for the same-named constructor parameters. As a result, it is ensured
  that all attributes that are strings (e.g. `name`) contain unicode strings,
  all attributes that are booleans (e.g. `propagated`) contain bool values,
  and all CIM values (e.g. `CIMProperty.value`) are of a :term:`CIM data type`.

* Added static `from_wbem_uri()` methods to `CIMInstanceName` and
  `CIMClassName`, that create a new object of these classes from a
  WBEM URI string.

* Added a `cimvalue()` function that converts input values specified
  at the interface of CIM object classes, into the internally stored
  CIM value. It is mainly used internally by the CIM object classes, but
  has also been made available at the public API of pywbem.
  Its functionality is very close to the existing `tocimobj()` function.

* Changed public attributes to Python properties with getter and setter methods
  in all CIM object classes (e.g. `CIMInstance`). This allows normalizing and
  applying checks for new values of these properties. In addition, it solves
  the Sphinx warnings about duplicate 'host' attribute when building the
  documentation (issue #761).

* Added catching of some exceptions M2Cryptro can raise that were not caught
  so far: SSL.SSLError, SSL.Checker.SSLVerificationError. These exceptions
  are now transformed into `pywbem.ConnectionError` and will therefore be
  caught by a caller of pywbem who is prepared for pywbem's own exceptions,
  but not necessarily aware of these M2Crypto exceptions. (issue #891)

* Added the catching of a httplib base exception to make sure all httplib
  exceptions are surfaced by WBEMConnection methods as a
  pywbem.ConnectionError (issue #916).

* In the `tomof()` methods of the CIM object classes, changed the formatting
  of the generated MOF to be more consistent with the CIM Schema MOF.

* Added new methods `CIMInstanceName.to_wbem_uri()` and
  `CIMClassName.to_wbem_uri()` that return the path as a WBEM URI string that
  conforms to untyped WBEM URIs as defined in DSP0207.
  The `CIMInstanceName.__str__()` and `CIMClassName.__str__()` methods still
  return the same WBEM URI string they previously did, but that is a historical
  format close to but not conformant to DSP0207 (issues #928, #943).

* Improved the way CIM-XML parsing errors are handled, by providing the
  original traceback information when re-raising a low-level exception
  as pywbem.ParseError, and re-established the improved exception message
  for invalid UTF-8 and XML characters that was broken since the move to
  using the SAX parser.

* Added support for properly hashing CIM objects (`CIMClass`, etc.) and
  CIM data types (particularly `CIMDateTime`), as long as these (mutable)
  objects are not changed. Because the objects must not be changed while
  being in a set, a new term "changed-hashable" has been introduced that
  describes this. This allows to have CIM objects in sets such that they
  behave as one would expect from a set. Previously, two CIM objects that
  were equal could both be in the same set, because their hash value was
  different. In the documentation, added a new section "Putting CIM objects
  in sets" that explains the considerations when utilizing the hash value of
  the mutable CIM objects.

* Added support for retrieving the operation recorders of a connection
  via a new `operation_recorders` read-only property (Issue #976).

* Extended `CIMParameter` to represent CIM parameter values in method
  invocations. As part of that, removed the deprecation from its `value`
  property and added an `embedded_object` property. Extended the testcases
  accordingly. Added an `as_value` argument to `CIMParameter.tocimxml()`
  and to `tocimxmlstr()` to allow control over whether the object is
  interpreted as a value or as a declaration. (Issue #950).

* Added a new conversion function to the public API: `cimtype()` takes a CIM
  data typed value (e.g. `Uint8(42)`) and returns the CIM data type name for
  it (e.g. "uint8"). Previously, this was an internal function (Issue #993).

* Added a new conversion function to the public API: `type_from_name()` takes
  a CIM data type name (e.g. "uint8") and returns the Python type representing
  that CIM data type (e.g. `Uint8`). Previously, this was an internal
  function (Issue #993).

* Extended `WBEMConnection.InvokeMethod()` to accept an iterable of
  `CIMParameter` objects as input parameters, in addition to the currently
  supported forms of input parameters. This allows specifying the
  `embedded_object` attribute (instead of inferring it from the value).
  (Issue #950).

* Docs: Improved the descriptions of CIM objects and their attributes to
  describe how the attributes are used to determine object equality and
  the hash value of the object.

* The child elements of CIM objects (e.g. properties of `CIMClass`) now
  preserve the order in which they had been added to their parent object.
  Methods such as `tomof()`, `tocimxml()`, and `to_wbem_uri()` now
  output the child elements of the target object in the preserved order.
  If a child element is initialized with an object that does not preserve
  order of items (e.g. a standard dict), a UserWarning is now issued.

* Added a new kind of input object for initializing CIM objects: An iterable
  of the desired CIM object type, and documented the already supported iterable
  of tuple(key, value) as a further input type.

* Improved checking of input objects when initializing a list of child
  elements in a CIM object(e.g.  properties of `CIMClass`), and raise
  TypeError if not supported.

* Made the `ValueMapping` class more generally available and no longer tied
  to the `WBEMServer` class. It is now described in the "Client" chapter of the
  documentation, and it is possible to create new `ValueMapping` objects by
  providing a `WBEMConnection` object (as an alternative to the `WBEMServer`
  object that is still supported, for compatibility). Issue #997.

* Extended the `ValueMapping` class; its objects now remember the context in
  which the value mapping is defined, in terms of the connection, namespace,
  class, and of the mapped CIM element (i.e. property, method or parameter).

* Extended the `ValueMapping` class by adding a `__repr__()` method that
  prints all of its attributes, for debug purposes.

* Added capability to mock WBEM Operations so that both pywbem and pywbem
  users can create unit tests without requiring a working WBEM Server,
  This feature allows the user to create CIM objects
  in a mock WBEM Server defined with the class `FakedWBEMConnection` and
  substitute that class for `WBEMConnection` to create a mock WBEM Server
  that responds to wbem operations.
  This enhancement is documented in the pywbem documentation section 10,
  Mock Support. See issue #838.

* Improved the messages in `ParseError` exceptions raised when parsing CIM-XML
  received from a WBEM server.

* The type of keybinding names in `CIMInstanceName` objects is now checked
  to be a string (or None, for unnamed keys). The requirement for a string
  has always been documented. This was changed as part of addressing issue
  #1026.

* Fixed the support for unnamed keys (i.e. instance paths with `KEYVALUE`
  or `VALUE.REFERENCE` elements without a parent `KEYBINDINGS` element).
  DSP0201 allows for this as a special case. (Issue #1026).

* Added support for instance qualifiers when parsing received CIM-XML responses
  (Issue #1030).

* CIM data type names specified for the `type` or `return_type` parameter
  of CIM objects are now checked for validity, and `ValueError` is raised
  if not valid (Issue 1043).

* Added a new method `CIMInstanceName.from_instance()` to create
  `CIMInstanceName` objects from class and instance. This was done as part of
  building the pywbem_mock environment. See issue #1069.

* The `url` property of `WBEMConnection` now transforms its input value
  to unicode. (Issue #1068).

* In the `WBEMListener` class, added support for using it as a context
  manager in order to ensure that the listener is stopped automatically
  upon leaving the context manager scope.

* In the `WBEMListener` class, added properties `http_started` and
  `https_started` indicating whether the listener is started for the
  respective port.

* `CIMInstance.tocimxml()/tocimxmlstr()` were extended to allow controlling
  whether the path is ignored even if present. This capability is used for
  ignoring the path in embedded instance parameter values (as part of
  fixing issue #1136).

* `CIMInstanceName/CIMClassName.tocimxml()/tocimxmlstr()` were extended to
  allow controlling whether the host and namespace are ignored even if
  present. This capability is not currently used but was introduced for
  consistency with ignoring the path on
  `CIMInstance.tocimxml()/tocimxmlstr()` (as part of fixing issue #1136).

* Improved the handling of certain connection errors by retrying and by
  issuing user warnings instead of printing if debug. (Issue #1118).

**Bug fixes:**

* Added `libxml2` operating system package as a dependency. It provides xmllint,
  which is used for testing.

* Fixed issue where `MOFCompiler.compile_str()` could not compile MOF that was
  defined through a MOF file containing `#pragma include` statements.
  This precluded using a string to define the classes to include in
  a mof compile in a string and required that the include be a file.
  See issue #1138.

* Fixed issue in `IterReferenceNames` and `IterAssociatiorNames` where it was
  not passing the `IncludeQualifiers` input parameter to the
  `OpenReferenceNames` operation. This should not have been a significant issue
  since in general qualifiers are not parts of instances. See issue #833.

* Also changed code in `IterQueryInstances` were parameters that are required
  by the called `ExecQuery` and `OpenQueryInstances` were defined as named
  arguments where since they are required, the name component is not required.
  This should not change operations except that when we were mocking the
  methods, it returns sees the parameter as `name=value` rather than value.
  See issue #833.

* Fixed the bug that `CIMInstanceName.tocimxml()` produced invalid CIM-XML
  if a keybinding value was set to an invalid CIM object type (e.g. to
  `CIMParameter`). The only allowed CIM object type for a keybinding value
  is `CIMInstanceName`, for keys that are references. Now, `TypeError` is
  raised in that case.

* Fix issues in `cim_operations.py` where a open or pull that returned with
  missing `enumeration_context` and `eos` would pass one of the internal tests.
  See issue #844

* Fixed an error in the CIM-XML representation of qualifier values where
  the values were not properly converted to CIM-XML. They are now properly
  converted using `atomic_to_cim_xml()`.

* Fixed local authentication for OpenWBEM and OpenPegasus. Due to one bug
  introduced in pywbem 0.9.0, it was disabled by accident. A second bug in
  local authentication has been there at least since pywbem 0.7.0.

* Fixed missing exception handling for CIM-XML parsing errors when parsing
  embedded objects. This could have caused low-level exceptions to be raised
  at the pywbem API.

* Fixed the problem that a `for`-loop over `CIMInstance` / `CIMInstanceName`
  objects iterated over the lower-case-converted property/key names. They now
  iterate over the names in their original lexical case, as documented,
  and consistent with the other iteration mechanisms for CIM objects.
  The test cases that were supposed to verify that did not perform the
  correct check and were also fixed.

* Fixed the bug that an (unsupported!) reference type could be specified for
  the return value of CIM methods, by raising `ValueError` if
  `CIMMethod.return_value` is initialized or set to "reference".

* Fixed issue introduced in mof_compiler when atomic_to_cimxml was cleaned up
  that did not allow using alias with some association classes.  Also
  added test for this issue. See issue #936

* Fixed the `CIMInstanceName.__str__()` and `CIMClassName.__str__()` methods to
  now return WBEM URI strings that are compliant to DSP0207. Changes include:

  * Local WBEM URIs (i.e. when authority/host is not set) now have a leading
    slash. That leading slash was previously omitted.
  * WBEM URIs with no namespace set now have a colon before the class name.
    Previously, the colon was produced only when a namespace was set.

  Issue #928.

* Fixed the comparison of `CIMProperty` objects to also consider the
  `embedded_object` attribute. Previously, this attribute was not considered,
  probably due to mistake (there is no reason not to consider it, as it is a
  user-provided input argument). Fixed the yaml testcases for embedded objects
  that failed as a result of that fix. These testcases did not set the
  `embedded_object` attribute to 'object', so it got its default value
  'instance', which caused the testcases to fail. Needed to use the long
  form for specifying property values inthe yaml now, because the short
  form does not allow for specifying the embedded_object attribute.

* Fixed the comparison of `CIMProperty` and `CIMMethod` objects to compare
  their `class_origin` attribute case-insensitively. If set, it contains a CIM
  class name. Previously, that attribute was compared case-sensitively.

* Fixed the use of hard coded value limits in the `ValueMapping` class
  for open ranges of the `ValueMap` qualifier, by making them dependent on
  the data type of the qualified element. This only affected elements
  with data types other than Uint32 and only if the `ValueMap` qualifier
  defined open ranges whose open side reached the min or max limit (i.e.
  was first or last in the list). Extended the test cases to include
  this situation (Issue #992).

* Fixed the lookup of the `Values` string for negative values in the
  `ValueMapping` class (found when solving #992).

* Added support for octal, binary and hex numbers when parsing MOF
  using the `MOFCompiler` class, in compliance with DSP0004 (Issue #974).
  Extended the testcases to cover such numbers.

* Fixed the issue that any use of `CIMDateTime` objects in the
  `TestClientRecorder` resulted in a `RepresenterError` being raised, by adding
  PyYAML representer and constructor functions that serialize `CIMDateTime`
  objects to YAML. Extended the testcases in `test_recorder.py` accordingly
  (Issues #702, #588).

* Fixed an AttributeError when `ValueMapping` was used for methods, when an
  internal method attempted to access the 'type' attribute of the CIM object.
  For methods, that attribute is called 'return_type'. Testcases for methods
  and parameters have now been added.

* Fixed the issue that leading and trailing slash characters in namespace
  names were preserved. This was leading to empty `NAMESPACE/NAME` elements,
  which can be rejected by WBEM servers. Now, leading and trailing slash
  characters on namespace names are stripped off in pywbem before sending
  the request to the server. (Issue #255).

* Fixed the issue that the parser for CIM-XML received from the WBEM server
  required the `VALUETYPE` attribute of the `KEYVALUE` element. DSP0201 defines
  `VALUETYPE` as optional, with a default of 'string'. That is now implemented.

* Fixed the issue that the parser for CIM-XML received from the WBEM server
  did not support hexadecimal representations of integers in the `KEYVALUE`
  element. They are now supported.

* Fixed the issue that the parser for CIM-XML received from the WBEM server
  accepted characters for char16 typed values outside of the range for
  UCS-2 characters. Such characters are now rejected by raising `ParseError`.

* Fixed the issue that the parser for CIM-XML received from the WBEM server
  tolerated invalid child elements under `INSTANCE`, `ERROR` and
  `PROPERTY.REFERENCE` elements, and invalid attributes on the `PROPERTY.ARRAY`
  element. This now results in a `ParseError` being raised.

* Fixed the issue that the parser for CIM-XML received from the WBEM server
  did not set the `propagated` attribute to `False` in `CIMProperty` objects
  retrieved from operations (e.g. as part of a class or instance), as
  required by DSP0201. It does now.

* Fixed the issue that `VALUE.NULL` (for representing array items that are NULL)
  was not supported in array values returned by the WBEM server. Note that it
  already had been supported for array values sent to the server, or in CIM-XML
  created by `toximcml()` methods (Issue #1022).

* Fixed the issue that the size of a fixed-size array property declaration was
  ignored when retrieving classes from CIM operations. It is now represented
  in the `array_size` attribute of the returned `CIMProperty` objects.
  (Issue #1031).

* Fixed the issue that the `xml:lang` attributes that are allowed on some
  CIM-XML elements have been rejected by raising `ParseError`. They are now
  tolerated but ignored (Issue #1033).

* Fixed the issue that mixed case values (e.g. "True") for the boolean
  attributes of the `QUALIFIER` element in CIM-XML was not supported and
  resulted in `ParseError` to be raised (Issue #1042).

* Fixed the issue that an empty boolean value in a CIM-XML response returned
  from a WBEM server was accepted and treated as a NULL value. This treatment
  does not conform to DSP0201. Empty boolean values now cause a `UserWarning`
  to be issued, but otherwise continue to work as before. (Issue #1032).

* Fixed the issue that invalid values were accepted for the boolean attributes
  of the `SCOPE` element in CIM-XML received from a WBEM server. They now cause
  `ParseError` to be raised (Issue #1040).

* Fixed the issue that invalid values for the boolean attributes of
  `QUALIFIER.DECLARATION` elements in CIM-XML responses from WBEM servers were
  tolerated and treated as `False`. They now cause `ParseError` to be raised
  (Issue #1041).

* Fixed the incorrect default value for the `propagated` constructor parameter
  of `CIMMethod`. Previously, the default value was `False` and it has been
  corrected to be `None`, consistent with its meaning of "information not
  available".
  The only CIM operations that take a `CIMMethod` object as input are
  `CreateClass()` and `ModifyClass()` (as part of the class that is created
  or modified). Because WBEM servers must ignore the `propagated` information
  on any elements in the provided class, this change is backwards compatible
  for the CIM operations. (Issue #1039).

* Added support for setting the `propagated` attribute on `CIMQualifier`
  objects returned from CIM operations to a default of `False` when it is
  not specified in the CIM-XML response, consistent with DSP0201, and
  consistent with how it was already done for other CIM objects.
  This change should normally be backwards compatible for pywbem users,
  because they don't even know whether the information has been set by
  the server or defaulted by the client as it is now done. (Issue #1039).

* Added support for setting the flavor attributes on `CIMQualifier` and
  `CIMQUalifierDeclaration` objects returned from CIM operations to their
  default values defined in CIM-XML, when they are not specified in the
  CIM-XML response, consistent with DSP0201, and consistent with how it
  was already done for other CIM objects.
  This change should normally be backwards compatible for pywbem users,
  because they don't even know whether the information has been set by
  the server or defaulted by the client as it is now done. (Issue #1039).

* In the wbemcli shell, fixed the "\*params" parameter of the `im()` function,
  to become "params" (an iterable). (Issue #1110).

* For the `InvokeMethod` operation, fixed that passing Python `None` as an input
  parameter valus resulted in `TypeError`. Extended the testclient testcases
  for `InvokeMethod` accordingly. Documented that `None` is a valid CIM typed
  value (Issue #1123).

* Fixed the error that embedded instances in parameter values were incorrectly
  represented with the CIM-XML element corresponding to their path (e.g.
  `VALUE.NAMEDINSTANCE`). The path is now correctly ignored on embedded instance
  parameter values, and they are always represented as `INSTANCE` elements
  (Issue #1136).

* Fixed the error that `CIMInstance.tocimxml()/tocimxmlstr()` represented its
  instance path always with a `VALUE.NAMEDINSTANCE` element and generated
  incorrect child elements depending which components of the instance path
  were present. Now, the element for the path depends correctly on the
  components that are present in the instance path (Issue #1136).

* Fixed the missing support for generating a `VALUE.INSTANCEWITHPATH` element
  in CIM-XML. This is needed when a `CIMInstance` with path has namespace and
  host. This error was previously now showing up because the
  `VALUE.NAMEDINSTANCE` element was always created (Issue #1136).

* Fixed the error that the `tocimxml()` and `tocimxmlstr()` methods of
  `CIMProperty`, `CIMQualifier` and `CIMQualifierDeclaration` represented
  NULL entries in array values using an empty `VALUE` element. They now
  correctly generate the `VALUE.NULL` element for NULL entries (Issue #1136).
  In order to provide for backwards compatibility to WBEM servers that
  do not support `VALUE.NULL`, a config option `SEND_VALUE_NULL` was added
  that by default sends `VALUE.NULL`, but allows for disabling that
  (Issue #1144).

* Fixed the error that the special float values `INF`, `-INF` and `NaN`
  were represented in lower case in CIM-XML. DSP0201 requires the
  exact case INF, -INF and NaN (Issue #1136).

* Fixed the error that float values in CIM-XML were truncated to six
  significant digits. They now have at least the minimum number of
  significant digits required by DSP0201: 11 for real32, and 17 for real64.
  (Issue #1136).

* In the `WBEMServer.get_central_instances()` method, fixed the error that a
  CIM status code of `CIM_ERR_METHOD_NOT_FOUND` returned when attempting to
  invoke the `GetCentralInstances()` CIM method lead to failing the
  `get_central_instances()` method. Now, execution continues with attempting
  the next approach for determining the central instances (Issue #1145).

* In the mof_compiler.bat script file, fixed the issue that it did not return
  an exit code if the MOF compiler failed (Issue #1156).

* Several fixes and display related improvements in the mof_compiler script:
  MOF file not found is now also handled instead of failing with an exception
  traceback. Exceptions are now displayed before exiting. Dry-run mode is now
  displayed, for information. The target MOF repository is now always
  displayed; previously it was displayed only in verbose mode. (Issue #1157).

**Cleanup:**

* Removed the unimplemented and unused `popitem()` method of `NocaseDict`.

* The `atomic_to_cim_xml()` function and any generated CIM-XML now generates
  boolean values in upper case 'TRUE' and 'FALSE', following the recommendation
  in DSP0201. Previously, boolean values were produced in lower case. This
  change is compatible for WBEM servers that meet the requirement of DSP0201
  to treat boolean values case-insensitively.

* Cleaned up the implementation of `CIMProperty/CIMParameter.tocimxml()`,
  so that it is now easier understandable (as part of fixing issue #1136).

* Removed any logging.NullHandler objects on pywbem loggers, including
  the pywbem listener loggers, because it turns out that for the use
  of loggers as a trace tool, the DEBUG level is used by the pywbem client
  and the INFO level is used by the pywbem listener, which are both not
  printed by default by the Python root logger, so the use of null handlers
  is not really needed (Issue #1175).

**Build, test, quality:**

* Added a boolean config variable `DEBUG_WARNING_ORIGIN` that when enabled
  causes a stack traceback to be added to the message of most warnings issued
  by pywbem. This allows identifying which code originated the warning.

* Cleaned up a lot of pylint warnings, for things like missing-doc, etc. so that
  we can actually review the remainder.  See issue #808.

* Update to current DMTF Schema (2.49.0) for pywbem tests. This also validates
  that pywbem can compile this DMTF released schema. See issue #816

* Add unit tests for the iter... operations. See issue #818

* Migrated installation and development setup to use `pbr` and Pip requirements
  files. As a consequence, removed files no longer used: `os_setup.py`,
  `uninstall_pbr_on_py26.py`.

* Added ability to test with minimum Python package level, according
  to the package versions defined in `minimum-constraints.txt`.

* Fixed a setup issue on Travis CI with duplicate metadata directories for the
  setuptools package. This issue prevented downgrading setuptools for the test
  with minimum package levels. Added script `remove_duplicate_setuptools.py`
  for that.

* Reorganized the make targets for installing pywbem and its dependencies
  somewhat. They now need to be used in this order:

  - make install - installs pywbem and dependencies for runtime
  - make develop - installs dependencies for development

  There are two new targets (that are included in the targets above,
  when first run after a `make clobber`):

  - make install_os - installs OS-level dependencies for runtime
  - make develop_os - installs OS-level dependencies for development

* Enabled testing on OS-X in the Travis CI.

* Added unit test for `WBEMServer` class using pywbem_mock.  See the file
  testsuite/test_wbemserverclass.py.  This test is incomplete today but tests
  most of the main paths.

**Documentation:**

Improved the complete pywbem documentation (Issue #1115). Some specific
changes are listed in the remainder of this section.

* The installation for Windows on Python 2.7 now requires an additional
  manual step for installing the M2CryptoWin32/64 Python package. For details,
  see the Installation section in the documentation.

* Fixed the documentation of the `CIMInstanceName.keybindings` setter
  method, by adding 'number' as an allowed input type.

* Moved the detail documentation of input to child element lists (e.g.
  for properties of `CIMInstance`) as a data type 'properties input object',
  etc., into the glossary. These types are now referenced as the type of
  the corresponding parameter.

* Clarified that the return type of `BaseOperationRecorder.open_file()`
  is a file-like object and that the caller is responsible for closing that
  file.

* Clarified in the description of the `return_type` init parameter of
  `CIMMethod` that array return types, void return types, and reference
  return types are all not supported in pywbem. See issue #1038, for void.

* Fixed the type `string` for the keys of the `CIMInstance.qualifiers`
  attribute to be `unicode string`.

* Many clarifications for CIM objects, e.g. about case preservation of
  CIM element names, or making copies of input parameters vs. storing the
  provided object.

* Improved the description of the `WBEMConnection.ModifyInstance()` method.

* Improved the description of the `tocimxml()` and `tocimxmlstr()` methods
  on CIM objects.

* Clarifications and small fixes in the documentation of the
  `WBEMConnection.Iter...()` generator functions.

* Added "New in pywbem M.N ..." text to descriptions of anything that was
  introduced in pywbem 0.8.0 or later.

* Clarified use of `ca_certs` parameter of `WBEMConnection` and its defaults in
  `DEFAULT_CA_CERT_PATHS`.

* Clarified that the instance path returned by the `CreateInstance()` operation
  method has classname, keybindings and namespace set.

* For CIM floating point types (real32, real64), added cautionary text for
  equality comparison and hash value calculation.

* Clarified that CIM-XML multi-requests are not supported by pywbem and why
  that is not a functional limitation.

* In the wbemcli shell, improved and fixed the description of operation
  functions (Issue #1110).

* Improved and fixed the description of `WBEMConnection` operation methods
  (Issue #1110).

* Improved and fixed the description of the pywbem statistics support
  (Issue #1115).

* Clarified the use of logging for the pywbem client (in section
  4.8 "WBEM operation logging") and for the pywbem listener (in
  section 6.1.2 "Logging in the listener" (Issue #1175).

This version contains all fixes up to pywbem 0.10.1.

**Incompatible changes:**

None

**Enhancements:**

* Added support for automatically finding out whether for RHEL/CentOS/Fedora,
  the IUS version of the Python development packages should be used,
  dependent on whether the Python package is from IUS.

* Added the MOF compiler API to the ``pywbem`` namespace. For compatibility, it
  is still available in the ``pywbem.mof_compiler`` namespace. See issue #634.

* Modify the pattern used for cim_operation.py request methods from using
  except/else to use except/finally to reduce number of places code like
  the recorder call and future statistics, log, etc. calls have to be included.
  No other functional changes.
  See issue #680

* Add operation statistics gathering **experimental**.  Adds the class
  Statistics which serves as a common place to gather execution time and
  request/reply size information on server requests and replies. The detailed
  information is available in WBEMConnection for operation execution time
  and request/reply content size at the end of each operation.

  When statistics gathering is enabled, the information is placed into the
  Statistics class where min/max/avg information is available for each
  operation type.
  Statistics gathering is enabled if the WBEMConnection attribute
  `enable_stats` is `True`.

  Statistics can be externalized through the snapshot method of the Statistics
  class.

  The functionality is marked experimental for the current release

  See issue #761

* Extended development.rst to define how to update dmtf mof and move the\
  variables for this process from test_compiler.py to a separate file to
  make them easy to find.  See issue #54

* Changed `CIMInstancename.__repr__()` to show the key bindings in the
  iteration order, and no longer in sorted order, to better debug
  iteration order related issues. See issue #585.

* Add new notebooks to the tutorials including notebooks for the
  WBEMServer class, the pull operations, and the Iter operations. See issue
  #682

* Added unit test for recorder. See issue #676

* Ensured that `CIMDateTime` objects for point in time values are
  timezone-aware when supplied with a timezone-naive `datetime` object.
  This does not change the behavior, but increases code clarity.
  Clarified that in the documentation of  `CIMDateTime`. See issue #698.

* Extend the documentation to list support for specific non-specification
  features of some WBEM servers. Issue #653.

* Extend cim_http.py, cim_operations.py, _statistics.py to handle optional
  WBEMServerResponseTime header from WBEMServer.  This HTTP header reports
  the server time in microseconds from request to response in the operation
  response.  The extension adds the WBEMConnection property
  last_server_response_time and places the time from the server into the
  attribute for this property.

* Extend pywbem to handle optional WBEMServerResponseTime header from a
  WBEM server.  This HTTP header reports the server time in microseconds from
  request to response in the operation response.  The extension adds the
  WBEMConnection property `last_server_response_time` and places the time from
  the server into the attribute for this property.
  It also passes server_response_time to statistics so that max/min/avg are
  maintained.  See issue # 687.

* Add test for wbemcli script that will execute the script and test
  results. issue #569

* **Experimental:** Add logging to record information passing between the pywbem
  client and WBEM servers both for the WBEMConnection methods that drive information
  interchange and the http requests and responses.  Logging includes a new module
  (_logging.py) that provides configuration of logging.
  The logging extends WBEMConnection with methods so that the user
  can chose to log a)Calls and returns from the WBEMConnection methods that
  interact with the WBEMServer (ex. getClass), b)http request/responses, c)both.
  The logging uses the python logging package and the output can be directed
  to either stderr or a file. The user can chose to log the complete
  requests and responses or size limited subsets (log_detail level). See issue #691.

* Clarify documentation on wbem operation recorder in client.rst. see
  issue #741

* Added an optional class path to the `CIMClass` class, as a convenience for
  the user in order so that `CIMClass` objects are self-contained w.r.t. their
  path. The class path is set in `CIMClass` objects returned by the `GetClass`,
  `EmumerateClasses`, and the class-level `Associators` and `References`
  operations. The path is added purely on the client side, based on existing
  information returned from WBEM server. This change does therefore not affect
  the interactions with WBEM servers at all.  issue #349.

* Added a ``host`` property to ``WBEMConnection`` which contains the host:port
  component of the WBEM server's URL.  This helps addressing issue #349.

* Made sure that ``repr()`` on CIM objects produces a reliable order of
  items such as properties, qualifiers, methods, parameters, scopes, by
  ordering them by their names. This makes debugging using ``repr()`` easier
  for pywbem users, and it also helps in some unit test cases of pywbem itself.

* Made sure that ``str()`` on ``CIMInstanceName`` produces reliable order of
  key bindings in the returned WBEM URI, by ordering them by key name.

**Bug fixes:**

* Fix issue with MaxObjectCount on PullInstances and PullInstancePaths
  CIM_Operations.py methods.  The MaxObjectCount was defined as a keyword
  parameter where it should have been be positional.  This should NOT impact
  clients unless they did not supply the parameter at all so that the result
  was None which is illegal(Pull... operations MUST include MaxObjectCount).
  In that case, server should return error.
  Also extends these requests to test the Pull.. methods for valid
  MaxObjectCount and context parameters. See issue #656.

* Add constructor parameter checking to QualifierDeclaration. See issue #645.

* Fixed TypeError "'str' does not support the buffer interface" during
  'setup.py develop' on Python 3.x on Windows (issue #661).

* Fixed ValueError "underlying buffer has been detached" during
  'setup.py develop' on Python 3.x on Windows (issue #661).

* Fixed names of Python development packages for SLES/OpenSUSE.

* Fixed issue in mof_compiler where instance aliases were incomplete. They
  only included the class component so that if they were used in the definition
  of other instances (ex. to define an association where a reference property
  was the aliased instance, the reference path was incomplete.) This is now
  a path with keybindings.  Note: It is the responsibility of the user to
  make these instances complete (i.e. with all key properties) see issue #679

* Correct documentation issue in cim_obj (Exceptions definition missing).
  See issue #677

* Add more mock tests.  ModifyInstance was missing and some others were
  missing an error test. issue#61

* add --version option to mof_compiler and pywbem cli tools.  Generates the
  pywbem version string.  See issue # 630

* Fix several issues in recorder including issue #609:indent by 4,
  # 676: invalid yaml representation for namedtuples that result from
  open/pull operations, #700 and #663: recorder won't write utf8 (at least for our
  tests), #698 : datetime test failures because of timezone, Most
  of these are tested with the new test_recorder.py unit test.

* Fix error in wbemcli with --enable_stats arg.  Since this was added in
  this release, the bug was never public. See issue #709

* Remove extra print in cim_operations. See issue # 704

* Correct Error in run_cimoperations with use of namespace in iter... function
  See issue #718. This was a test code issue. No changes to the iter
  operations.

* Correct issue with Recorder creating non-text files.  This issue
  Documents the requirement for text files and also adds a static
  method to force creation of the recorder output as a text file.
  See issue # 700

* Correct issue in wbemcli.bat where it was not returning error level.
  see issue #727

* Correct issue where dependency pip installs end up with old version
  of coverage package. This old version generates unwanted deprecation
  messages that are fixed after version 4.03. This requires a change to
  the travis.yaml file directly to force a reinstall of coverage.
  See issue #734

* Fixed the issue that ``CIMProperty.__init__()`` had an incorrect check for
  the ``reference_class`` parameter, where it checked the class name specified
  in that parameter to be the creation class of the referenced instance.
  According to DSP0201, reference_class is the declared class, which can be
  a superclass of the  creation class of the referenced instance.
  This is related to issue #598

* Modify mof_compiler documentation to indication issues with property
  names that are compiler keywords. See issue #62.

* Correct issue where dependency pip installs end up with old version
  of coverage package. This old version generates unwanted deprecation
  messages that are fixed after version 4.03. This requires a change to
  the travis.yaml file directly to force a reinstall of coverage.
  See issue #734

* Fix minor doc issue in client.rst. See issue #740.

* Fixed that older versions of pip and setuptools failed or were
  rejected on some older Linux distros during make develop or make install,
  by upgrading them in these steps. See issues #759 and #760.

* Clean up pylint new messages tied to use of len and if else. See issue #770

**Build, test, quality:**

* Added Python 3.6 to the environments to be tested in Travis CI and Appveyor
  CI (issue #661).

* Added Python 2.6, 3.4 and 3.5 to the environments to be tested in Appveyor
  CI (issue #661).

* Fixed uninstall_pbr_on_py26.py to remove 'pbr' only if installed
  (issue #661).

* Fixed TypeError about dict ordering on Python 3.6 in unit test
  'test_nocasedict.TestOrdering' (issue #661).

* Added a testcase for `CIMInstanceName` to compare two objects with
  different ordering of their key bindings for equality. See issue #686.

* In ``parse_property_reference()`` in ``tupleparse.py``, a number of
  attributes of the new ``CIMProperty`` object had been updated after having
  created it. That bypasses the checks in its ``__init__()`` method.
  This has been improved to pass these values in when creating the object.

* Tolerated incorrect Unicode characters in output of commands invoked by
  ``os_setup.py`` (used for installation) that sometimes occurred on Windows
  (e.g. on the Appveyor CI with Python 3).

* Improved the build process to ensure that half-built artefacts are
  removed before building (issue #754).

* Pinned the version of the `wheel` package to <0.30.0 for Python 2.6,
  because `wheel` removed Python 2.6 support in its 0.30.0 version.

**Documentation:**

* Documented that pywbem is not supported on Python 2.6 on Windows.
  and that 64-bit versions of Python are not supported on Windows.

* Added material to README and changed to use restructured text. issue #642


pywbem 0.10.0
-------------

Released: 2016-12-20

**Incompatible changes:**

* All methods of the `WBEMSubscriptionManager` class that returned instance
  paths (or lists thereof) in pywbem 0.9.x now return the complete instances
  (or lists thereof) (pr #607).

* In `wbemcli`, removed the long global function names (e.g.
  `EnumerateInstances`), and kept the short names (e.g. `ei`) (issue #548).

**Enhancements:**

* **Experimental:** Added new methods to `WBEMConnection` to provide integrated
  APIs for the non-pull and pull operations, reducing the amount of code app
  writers must produce and providing a pythonic (generator based) interface
  for the methods that enumerate instances and instance paths, enumerator
  associators and references.
  These new methods have names in the pattern
  `Iter<name of original function>`. Thus, for example the new method
  `IterEnumerateInstances` creates a new API to integrate `EnumerateInstances`
  and the `OpenEnumerateInstancesWithPath` / `PullInstancesWithPath`.
  (issue #466).

* Modified the XML parser to use SAX in place of minidom for operation response
  processing and indication processing. This is a significant reduction in
  memory usage (issue #498).

* Declared the WBEM indications API and the WBEM server API to be final. These
  APIs had been introduced in pywbem 0.9.0 as experimental.

* Added enter and exit methods to `WBEMSubscriptionManager` to enable using it
  as a context manager, whose exit method automatically cleans up by calling
  `remove_all_servers()` (issue #407).

* Added methods to the operation recorder (class `BaseOperationRecorder`) for
  disabling and enabling it (issue #493).

* The "Name" property of indication filters created via the
  `WBEMSubscriptionManager` class can now be controlled by the user (pr #607).

* Indication filter, listener destination and indication subscription
  instances created via the `WBEMSubscriptionManager` class, that are "owned",
  are now conditionally created, dependent on the owned instances that have
  been discovered upon restart of the `WBEMSubscriptionManager` (pr #607).

* Modified operations that have a "PropertyList" attribute to allow the
  "PropertyList" attribute to have a single string in addition to the iterable.
  Previously this caused an XML error (issue #577).

* Added an option `-s` / `--script` to `wbemcli` that supports executing
  scripts in the wbemcli shell.

  Some example scripts are provided in the examples directory:

  - `wbemcli_server.py` - Creates a `WBEMServer` object named `SERVER`
    representing a WBEM server.

  - `wbemcli_quit.py` - Demo of terminating wbemcli from within a script.

  - `wbemcli_display_args.py` - Demo of displaying input arguments.

  - `wbemcli_count_instances.py` - Counts classes and instances in a server.

  - `wbemcli_clean_subscriptions.py` - Removes all subscriptions, filters, and
    listener destination instances in a server.

  - `test_wbemcli_script.sh` - A shell script that demos scripts.

* Improved robustness and diagnostics in `os_setup.py` (issue #556).

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed the use of a variable before it was set in the `remove_destinations()`
  method of class `WBEMSubscriptionManager`.

* Fixed a compatibility issue relative to pywbem 0.7.0, where the
  `pywbem.Error` class was no longer available in the `pywbem.cim_http`
  namespace. It has been made available in that namespace again, for
  compatibility reasons. Note that using sub-namespaces of the `pywbem`
  namespace such as `pywbem.cim_http` has been deprecated in pywbem 0.8.0
  (issue #511).

* Fixed an `AttributeError` in the `remove_all_servers()` method of
  `WBEMSubscriptionManager` and dictionary iteration errors in its
  `remove_server()` method (pr #583).

* Fixed a `TypeError` in the `TestClientRecorder` operation recorder that
  occurred while handling a `ConnectionError` (this recorder is used by the
  `--yamlfile` option of `run_cim_operations.py`) (issue #587).

* Fixed several errors in recorder on Python 3 (issue #531).

* In wbemcli, several fixes in the short global functions (issue #548).

* Fixed name of python devel package for Python 3.4 and 3.5.

* Several changes, fixes and improvements on WBEMSubscriptionManager
  (issues #462, #540, #618, #619).

* Added a check for unset URL target in recorder (issue #612).

* Fixed access to None in recorder (issue #621)

**Build, test, quality:**

* Added flake8 as an additional lint tool. It is executed with `make check`.
  Fixed all flake8 issues (issues #512, #520, #523, #533, #542, #560, #567,
  #575).

* Changed names of the pylint and flake8 config files to match the default
  names defined for these utilities (pylintrc and .flak8) (issue #534).

* Added CIM Schema archive to the repository, in order to avoid repeated
  downloads during testing in the CI systems (issue #49).

* Added `git` as an OS-level dependency for development (it is used by GitPython
  when building the documentation) (pr #581).

* Added `wheel` as a Python dependency for development. This package is not
  installed by default in some Linux distributions such as CentOS 7, and
  when installing into the system Python this becomes an issue (pr #622).

* Added retry in setup script to handle xmlrpc failures when installing
  prerequisites from PyPI.

* Fixed logic errors in pycmp compatibility checking tool.

* Changed makefile to skip documentation build on Python 2.6 due to
  Sphinx having removed Python 2.6 support (issue #604).

* Fixed UnboundLocalError for exc in setup.py (issue #545).

* Added an executable `run_enum_performance.py` to the testsuite to test pull
  performance. It generates a table of the relative performance of
  `EnumerateInstances` vs. `OpenEnumerateInstances` / `PullInstancesWithPath`
  performance over a range of MaxObjectCount, response instance sizes, and
  total number of instances in the response.

* Completed the `test_client.py` mock tests for all instance operations.

* Improved the tests in `run_cim_operations.py`.

**Documentation:**

* Added the global functions available in the wbemcli shell to the
  documentation (issue #602).

* Improved usage information for the "Tutorial" section, to make usage of
  Jupyter tutorials more obvious (issue #470).

* Added "Installation" and "Development" sections to the documentation, and
  moved some content from the "Introduction" section into a new "Appendix"
  section. Added an installation trouble shooting section to the appendix
  (pr #509).

* Added a section "Prerequisite operating system packages" to the documentation
  that describes the prerequisite packages by distribution (pr #549).

* Fixed a documentation build error on Python 2.6, by pinning the GitPython
  version to <=2.0.8, due to its use of unittest.case which is not available
  on Python 2.6 (issue #550).

* Clarified the behavior for the default `WBEMConnection` timeout (`None`)
  (issue #628).

* Fixed a documentation issue where the description of `CIMError` was not
  clear that the exception object itself can be accessed by index and slice
  (issue #511).

* Added the `wbemcli` global functions to the documentation (issue #608).


pywbem 0.9.0
------------

Released: 2016-09-06

**Deprecations:**

* Deprecated the use of the `value` instance variable and ctor parameter
  of the `CIMParameter` class, because that class represents CIM parameter
  declarations, which do not have a default value. Accessing this instance
  variable and specifying an initial value other than `None` now causes a
  `DeprecationWarning` to be issued.

* Deprecated ordering comparisons for `NocaseDict`, `CIMInstance`,
  `CIMInstanceName`, and `CIMClass` objects. This affects the ordering
  comparisons between two such objects, not the ordering of the items within
  such a dictionary. Use of ordering operators on objects of these classes
  now causes a `DeprecationWarning` to be issued.

* Deprecated the `methodname` input argument of `CIMMethod()`, and renamed it
  to `name`. `methodname` still works but its use causes a `DeprecationWarning`
  to be issued.

* Deprecated the use of the `verify_callback` parameter of `WBEMConnection`.
  because it is not used with the Python ssl module and will probably be
  removed completely in the future.  Its use now causes a `DeprecationWarning`
  to be issued. (Issue #297)

**Known Issues:**

* Installing PyWBEM on Python 2.6 has a conflict with the `pbr` package
  from PyPI, resulting in a TypeError: "dist must be a Distribution
  instance". This issue is specific to Python 2.6 and does not occur in
  any of the other supported Python versions (2.7, 3.4, 3.5). This issue
  can be mitigated by uninstalling the `pbr` package, or if that is not
  possible, by migrating to Python 2.7. See issue #26 on GitHub.

* MOF using names that are reserved keywords will fail to compile in the
  MOF compiler. For example, a CIM property named 'indication'.
  See issue #62 on GitHub.

**Clean Code:**

* Moved the following unused modules from the pywbem package directory
  into a new `attic` directory, in order to clean up the pywbem
  package:

  - `cim_provider.py`
  - `cim_provider2.py`
  - `cimxml_parse.py`
  - `test_cimxml_parse.py`
  - `twisted_client.py`

* Moved the script-related portions of the `pywbem/mof_compiler.py` module
  into the `mof_compiler` script.

* Moved the complete `pywbem/wbemcli.py` module into the `wbemcli` script.

* Removed half-baked code for HTTP proxy/tunneling support.

**Enhancements:**

* Implemented pull operations per DMTF specification DSP0200 and DSP0201.
  This includes the following new client operations to execute enumeration
  sequences:

  - OpenEnumerateInstances
  - OpenEnumerateInstancePaths
  - OpenAssociatorInstances
  - OpenAssociatorInstancePaths
  - OpenReferenceInstances
  - OpenReferenceInstancePaths
  - OpenQueryInstances
  - PullInstances
  - PullInstancesWithPath
  - PullInstancePaths
  - CloseEnumeration

  The EnumerationCount operation is NOT implemented, because it is both
  deprecated and unusable. (Issue #9)

  Unit tests of the pull operations are included and mock tests are written
  for at least some parts of the pull operations.

* Implemented support for reading information from WBEM servers according to
  the DMTF WBEM Server Profile (DSP1071) and DMTF Profile Registration Profile
  (DSP1033) with a new `WBEMServer` class. Note that not everyhting in these
  profiles needs to be implemented in the WBEM server for this to work:

  - The `WBEMServer` class is a client's view on a WBEM server and provides
    consistent and convenient access to the common elements of the server,
    including namespace names, interop namespace name, registered profile
    information, server branding, and central/scoping class algorithms.

  - Added unit tests for this new class in `run_cim_operations.py` and
    `test_client.py`.

  - Added a demo of the discovery abilities of the `WBEMServer` class in the
    `examples/explore.py` script.

  **Experimental** - This new class is experimental for pywbem 0.9.0
  because this is the initial release of a significant change and subject to
  changes to the API.

  (Issues #9, #346, #468)

* Implemented support for WBEM subscription management and a WBEM indication
  listener:

  - Added a `WBEMListener` class that allows the creation of a listener entity
    to receive indications.

  - Added a `WBEMSubscriptionManager` class that allows management of
    indication subscriptions, indication filters, and listener destination
    instances on the WBEM Server using the new WBEMServer class.

  - Added unit tests for these new classes and extended other existing tests
    accordingly, e.g. `run_cim_operations.py`.

  **Experimental** - These new classes are experimental for pywbem 0.9.0
  because this is the initial release of a significant change and subject
  to changes to the API.

  (Issues #66, #421, #414, #379, #378)

* The distribution formats released to PyPI have been extended. There are now:

  - Source archive (existed)
  - Universal wheel (new)

  (Issue #242)

* Starting with pywbem 0.9.0, pywbem no longer stores the distribution archives
  in the repository, because the process for releasing to PyPI creates new
  distribution archives instead of using the created ones. This makes it
  difficult to ensure that the archives stored in the repository are the
  same.

* Upgraded M2Crypto to use official 0.24.0 from PyPI.

* Added check for minimum Python version 3.4 when running on Python 3.
  That requirement was already documented, now it is also enforced in the code.

* Migrated API documentation to Sphinx.

* Improved documentation of many classes of the external API.

* Replaced `[]` and `{}` default arguments with None.

* Changed the return value of `repr()` for `WBEMConnection`, CIM type
  classes (e.g. `Sint8`, `CIMDateTime`), and CIM object classes
  (e.g. `CIMInstance`) so that they now return all attributes in a
  reasonable order, and are suitable for debugging.

* Clarified in the description of `CIMClassName.__str__()` and
  `CIMInstanceName.__str__()` that they return the WBEM URI representation
  of the class path and instance path.

* Changed the return value of `str()` for CIM object classes
  (e.g. `CIMProperty`) so that they now return a short set of the most
  important attributes for human consumption.
  Specifically, this resulted in the following changes:

  - For `CIMProperty`, reduced the complete set of attributes to a short set.
  - For `CIMQualifierDeclaration`, added the attribute `value`.

* Changes in the `CIMError` exception class:

  - Changed the behavior of the `__str__()` method to return a human readable
    string containing the symbolic name of the status code, and the status
    description. The previous behavior was to return a Python representation
    of the tuple status code, status description.
  - Added properties `status_code` (numeric CIM status code),
    `status_code_name` (symbolic name of CIM status code), and
    `status_description` (CIM status description).
  - Updated the documentation to no longer show the unused third tuple element
    `exception_obj`. It was never created, so this is only a doc change.

* Added CIM status codes 20 to 28, specifically to support the pull operations.

* Changed the `ParseError` exception to be derived from the `Error` base
  exception, so that now all pywbem specific exceptions are derived from
  `Error`.

* Added `tocimxmlstr()` as a global function and as methods on all CIM
  object classes. It returns the CIM-XML representation of the object
  as a unicode string either in a single-line variant, or in a prettified
  multi-line variant.

* Created `tomof()` for `CIMProperty` making common functionality available
  to both class and instance `tomof()` (PR #151)

* Added an optional `namespace` parameter to the
  `WBEMConnection.CreateInstance()` method, for consistency with other methods,
  and to have an explicit alternative to the namespace in the path component of
  the `NewInstance` parameter.

* The `ClassName` parameter of several operation methods can be specified
  as both a string and a `CIMClassName` object. In the latter case, a namespace
  in that object was ignored so far. Now, it is honored. This affects the
  following `WBEMConnection` methods: `EnumerateInstanceNames`,
  `EnumerateInstances`, `EnumerateClassNames`, `EnumerateClasses`, `GetClass`,
  `DeleteClass`.

* Enhanced the CIM integer data types (e.g. `pywbem.Uint8()`) to accept all
  input parameters that are supported by `int()`.

* Added the concept of a valid value range for the CIM integer data types, that
  is enforced at construction time. For compatibility, this strict checking can
  be turned off via a config variable:
  `pywbem.config.ENFORCE_INTEGER_RANGE = False`.

* Extended `wbemcli` arguments to include all possible arguments that would
  be logical for a ssl or non-ssl client. This included arguments for
  ca certificates, client keys and certificates, timeout. It also modifies
  the server argument to use http:// or https:// prefix and suffix with
  :<port number> and drops the old arguments of `--port` and `--no-ssl`

* Improved Swig installation code by reinstalling Swig if it was installed
  but still cannot be found in PATH (e.g. if the installation was tampered
  with).

* Removed dependency on git (this was a leftover from when M2Crypto needed
  to be obtained from its development repo).

* Added debug prints for two probably legitimate situations where socket
  errors are ignored when the server closes or resets the connection.
  These debug prints can be enabled via the `debug` instance variable
  of the `WBEMConnection` object; they are targeted at development for
  investigating these situations.

* Extended run_cim_operations.py which is a live test against a server.
  It has only been tested against OpenPegasus but was extended to cover
  more details on more of the operation types and to create a test
  subclass to specifically test against OpenPegasus if OpenPegasus is
  detected as the server.

* Added description of supported authentication types in WBEM client API.

* Allowed tuple as input for `PropertyList` parameter of `WBEMConnection`
  operation methods. Documentation indicated that iterable was allowed but was
  limited to list. (Issue #347)

* Added a tutorial section to the generated documentation, using
  Jupyter Notebooks for each tutorial page. (Issue #324)

* Added the concept of operation recording on WBEM connections, that supports
  user-written operation recorders e.g. for tracing purposes. Added an
  operation recorder that generates test cases for the `test_client`
  unit test module. (Issue #351)

* Extended `wbemcli` for all pull operations. (Issue #341)

* Changed command line options of `mof_compiler` command to be consistent
  with `wbemcli`, and added support for specifying certificate related
  options. use of the old options is checked and causes an according error
  message to be displayed. Note, this is an incompatible change in the
  command line options. (Issue #216)

* Cleaned up exception handling in `WBEMConnection` methods: Authentication
  errors are now always raised as `pywbem.AuthError` (OpenWBEM raised
  `pywbem.ConnectionError` in one case), and any other bad HTTP responses
  are now raised as a new exception `pywbem.HTTPError`.

* Clarified `MofParseError` by defining attributes as part of the class init
  and moving some code from productions to the class itself (Issue #169). This
  makes the `MofParseError` exception more suitable for use from the productions
  themselves. The original definition was really only for use as a call from
  ply. Add tests for invalid qualifier flavors to unit tests and add test in
  mof_compiler.py for conflicting flavors ex. tosubclass and restricted in
  the same definition. This test uses the new `MofParseError`. (Issue #204)

* Extended PropertyList argument in request operations to be either list
  or tuple. (Issue #347)

* Added support for representing control characters in MOF strings using MOF
  escape sequences, e.g. U+0001 becomes `"\x0001"`.

* Modified qualifier MOF output to stay within 80 column limits.
  (Issue #35)

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed `KeyError` when iterating over `CIMInstance` and `CIMInstanceName`
  objects.

* Fixed bug that MOF escape sequences in strings were passed through
  unchanged, into generated MOF, by removing needless special-casing code.

* Fixed bug with class MOF generation where output was not including array
  indicator ([]). (Issue #233)

* Moved class property MOF output processing to `CIMProperty` and fixed issue
  where default values were not being generated. (Issues #223 and #231)

* Fixed bug in method MOF output where array flag "[]" was left off array
  parameters.

* In the `WBEMConnection.ModifyInstance()` method, the class names in the
  instance and path component of the `ModifiedInstance` parameter are required,
  but that was neither described nor checked. It is now described and checked.

* In the `WBEMConnection.ModifyInstance()` method, a host that was specified in
  the path component of the `ModifiedInstance` parameter incorrectly caused
  an INSTANCEPATH element to be created in the CIM-XML. This bug was fixed,
  and a host is now ignored.

* Fixed a bug where the CIM datetime string returned by the `str()` function
  on `CIMDateTime` interval objects contained incorrect values for the minutes
  and seconds fields on Python 3. (Issue #275).

* Fixed an IndexError in cim_http.wbem_request() that occurred during handling
  of another exception.

* Fixed issue with Python 3 and https that was causing connect() to fail.
  This completely separates connect() code for Python 3 ssl module from
  Python 2 M2Crypto.

* Fixed problem that wbemcli in Python 3 when used without existing history
  file would fail with "TypeError: 'FileNotFoundError' object is not
  subscriptable". (Issue #302)

* Fixed issue with tomof() output where datetime values were not quoted.
  (Issue #289)

* Eliminated automatic setting of toinstance flavor in mof_compiler when
  tosubclass is set.  Also enabled use of toinstance flavor if defined
  in a class or qualifier declaration. (Issue #193)

* Fixed problem in class-level associator operations that namespace was
  classname when classname was passed as a string. (Issue #322)

* Fixed hole in checking where class CIMMethod allowed None as a return_type.
  (Issue #264)

* Fixed a documentation issue with associators/references return types. It was
  documented as a list of classes for class level return, but it actually is a
  list of tuples of classname, class. (Issue #339)

* Created a common function for setting SSL defaults and tried to create
  the same level of defaults for both Python2 (M2Crypto) and Python 3 (SSL
  module).  The minimum level protocol set by the client is TLSV1 now whereas
  in previous versions of pywbem it was SSLV23. (Issue #295)

* Fixed issue where mof_compiler was setting values for compile of instances
  into the class object and also setting the values for the last compiled
  instance in a compile unit into all other compiled instances for the same
  class. Since the concept of compiling a path into compiled instances is
  flawed (there is no requirement to include all properties into a instance to
  compile that code was removed so that the path is NOT build into a compiled
  instance. Finally the qualifiers from the class were also included in
  compiled instances which was incorrect and an accident of the code. They are
  no longer included into the compiled instances.) (Issue #402)

* Fixed description in INSTALL.md to correctly describe how to establish
  OS-level prerequisites.

* Cleaned up the timeouts on SSL and created specific tests for timeouts
  against a live server. (Issues #363, #364)


pywbem 0.8.4
------------

Released: 2016-05-13

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed an IndexError in cim_http.wbem_request() that occurred during
  handling of another exception.

* Fixed problem that wbemcli in Python 3 when used without existing history
  file would fail with "TypeError: 'FileNotFoundError' object is not
  subscriptable" (issue #302).

* Fixed issues with Python 3 and HTTPS that were causing the connecttion
  to fail. This completely separates the `connect()` code for Python 3
  (using the Python SSL module) from the code for Python 2 (using
  M2Crypto) (issues #150, #273, #274, #288).

**Enhancements:**

* Improved description in INSTALL.md to better describe how to establish
  OS-level prerequisites.

* Improved Swig installation code by reinstalling Swig if it was installed
  but still cannot be found in PATH (e.g. if the installation was tampered
  with).

* Removed dependency on git (this was a leftover from when M2Crypto needed
  to be obtained from its development repo).

* Added debug prints for two probably legitimate situations where socket
  errors are ignored when the server closes or resets the connection.
  These debug prints can be enabled via the `debug` instance variable
  of the WBEMConnection object; they are targeted at development for
  investigating these situations.

* Added check for minimum Python version 3.4 when running on Python 3.
  That requirement was already documented, now it is also enforced in
  the code.

* Enhanced the wbemcli script with options supporting certificates.
  For details, invoke with --help, or look at the online documentation.
  NOTE: The --no-ssl and --port options have been removed. Specify
  the protocol and port number in the server URL.

**Clean code:**

* Removed half-baked code for HTTP proxy/tunneling support.


pywbem 0.8.3
------------

Released: 2016-04-15

**Bug fixes:**

* To address some M2Crypto issues, upgraded to use M2Crypto >=0.24 from
  PyPI.

* For Windows, using M2CryptoWin32/64 >=0.21 from PyPI, in order to
  avoid the Swig-based build in Windows.

* Improved the mechanism to build the LEX/YACC table modules, so that
  import errors for freshly installed packages (e.g. M2Crypto) no longer
  occur.

**Enhancements:**

* Added Windows versions of WBEM utility commands: wbemcli.bat,
  mof_compiler.bat.


pywbem 0.8.2
------------

Released: 2016-03-20

**Bug fixes:**

* Eliminated dependency on `six` package during installation of pywbem.
  (Andreas Maier)

**Dependencies:**

* Pywbem 0.8.x has the following dependencies on other PyPI packages
  (see `install_requires` argument in setup script):

  - `M2Crypto`
  - `ply`
  - `six`


pywbem 0.8.1
------------

Released: 2016-03-18

**Known Issues:**

* Installing PyWBEM on Python 2.6 has a conflict with the `pbr` package
  from PyPI, resulting in a TypeError: "dist must be a Distribution
  instance". This issue is specific to Python 2.6 and does not occur in
  any of the other supported Python versions (2.7, 3.4, 3.5). This issue
  can be mitigated by uninstalling the `pbr` package, or if that is not
  possible, by migrating to Python 2.7. See issue #26 on GitHub.

* MOF using names that are reserved keywords will fail to compile in the
  MOF compiler. For example, a CIM property named 'indication'.
  See issue #62 on GitHub.

* The Pulled Enumeration Operations introduced in DSP0200 1.3 are not
  supported in this release. See issue #9 on GitHub.

* Note that some components of this PyWBEM Client package are still
  considered experimental:

  - The twisted client module `twisted_client.py`.
  - The Python provider modules `cim_provider.py` and `cim_provider2.py`.
  - The CIM indication listener in the `irecv` directory.
    See issue #66 on GitHub.

**Changes:**

* The MOF compiler is now available as the command 'mof_compiler' that gets
  installed into the Python script directory. It is now separate from the
  'mof_compiler' module within the 'pywbem' package. In pywbem 0.7.0, the
  module was at the same time the script.  (Andreas Maier)

* The WBEM client CLI is now available as the command 'wbemcli' that gets
  installed into the Python script directory. It is now separate from the
  'wbemcli' module within the 'pywbem' package. In pywbem 0.7.0, the module
  was at the same time the script.  (Andreas Maier)

* In pywbem 0.7.0, most symbols defined in the sub-modules of the 'pywbem'
  package were folded into the 'pywbem' package namespace, cluttering it
  significantly. The symbols in the 'pywbem' package namespace have been
  reduced to a well-defined set that is now declared the external API of
  the WBEM client library, and is supposed to be sufficient. If you find
  that you need something you were used to, please think twice as to
  whether that makes sense to be part of the external PyWBEM API, and if
  so, let us know by opening an issue.

* Since pywbem 0.7.0, some exceptions that can be raised at the external API of
  the WBEM client library have been cleaned up.

**Enhancements:**

* Verify certificates against platform provided CA trust store in
  /etc/pki/tls/certs. Linux only.  (Peter Hatina)

* Added '-d' option to MOF compiler that causes the compiler to perform a
  dry-run and just check the MOF file syntax. This allows to more easily
  detect included MOF files when used together with the '-v' option.
  (Jan Safranek)

* Added support for non-ASCII (Unicode) characters.  (Michal Minar, Andreas
  Maier)

* Improved information in the message text of some exceptions (`TypeError`
  and `KeyError` in `cim_obj.py`, `ValueError` in `cim_obj.py`, and
  `ParseError` in `tupleparse.py`).  (Andreas Maier)

* Moved the definition of the pywbem version from `setup.py` to `__init__.py`,
  in order to make it available to programs using pywbem as
  `pywbem.__version__`.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for direct iteration over NocaseDict objects using `for`
  and `in` by adding `__iter__()`, e.g. for use with `CIMInstance.properties`.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Added more instance attributes to be shown in `repr()` on `CIMProperty` and
  other classes in cim_obj.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added and improved docstring-based documentation in the pywbem modules
  cim_operations, cim_http, cim_obj, cim_types, and the pywbem module.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Improved the way missing file:// URL support on Windows is handled, by
  now issuing a proper error message instead of stumbling across the
  missing socket.AF_UNIX constant.  (Andreas Maier)

* Improved the way missing OWLocal authorization with the OpenWBEM server
  is handled on Windows, by now issuing a proper error message instead of
  stumbling across the missing `os.getuid()` function.  (Andreas Maier)

* Improved Windows portability by no longer attempting to import `pwd` in
  case the userid is not set in the environment variables that are checked
  when the WBEM server is local.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for ExecQuery operation to twisted client.  (Robert Booth)

* Added get() methods on CIMInstance and CIMInstanceName to step up to the
  statement that they behave like dictionaries w.r.t. properties and key
  bindings.  (Andreas Maier)

* Improved help text of test_cim_operations.py test program.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Added an optional Params argument to `InvokeMethod()`, that is an ordered
  list of CIM input parameters, that preserves its order in the CIM-XML
  request message. This is to accomodate deficient WBEM servers that do
  not tolerate arbitrary order of method input parameters as required by
  the standard. The new argument is optional, making this a backwards
  compatible change of `InvokeMethod()`.  (Andreas Maier)

* Cleaned up the public symbols of each module by making symbols private
  that are used only internally. Specifically, the following symbols have
  been made private: In `cimxml_parse`: `_get_required_attribute`,
  `_get_attribute`, `_get_end_event`, `_is_start`, `_is_end`. In `cim_xml`:
  `_text` (was: `Text`).  (Andreas Maier)

* Cleaned up symbols imported by wildcard import by defining `__all__` in
  each module with only the public symbols defined in that module (removing
  any symbols imported into the module), except for the following modules
  which define less than the complete set of public symbols in their
  `__all__`: `mof_compiler`, `twisted_client`, `tupleparse`, `cimxml_parse`,
  `cim_http`.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for using CDATA section based escaping in any requests sent
  to the WBEM server. The default is still XML entity reference based
  escaping, the CDATA based escaping can be turned on by setting the switch
  `_CDATA_ESCAPING` accordingly, which is a global variable in the cim_xml
  module.  (Andreas Maier)

* Simplified the exceptions that can be raised by `WBEMConnection` methods,
  and improved the information in the exception messages. See description
  of `WBEMConnection` class for details.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for timeouts to `WBEMConnection`, via a new `timeout` argument,
  that defaults to no timeout.  (This finally increased the minimum version
  of Python to 2.6.  (Andreas Maier)

* Improved installation process of PyWBEM, particularly related to
  M2Crypto.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for Python 3.  Issue #3 on GitHub.
  (Ross Peoples, Andreas Maier)

**Bug fixes:**

* Fix syntax error in CIM DTDVERSION error path.  Allow KEYVALUE
  VALUETYPE attribute to be optional as specified in the DTD.
  (Andreas Linke)

* Added parsing of `InvokeMethod` return value and output parameters for
  Twisted Python client.  (Tim Potter)

* Fixed `cim_provider2.py` to properly support `shutdown()` and `can_unload()`
  (called from CMPI cleanup() functions).  Support was recently added
  to cmpi-bindings for this.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed XML parsing to accept SFCB-style embedded instance parameters.
  (Mihai Ibanescu)

* Use getpass module instead of pwd to detect local user to fix Win32.
  (Tim Potter)

* Re-throw `KeyError` exceptions with capitalised key string instead
  of lower cased version in `NocaseDict.__getitem__()`.  (Tim Potter)

* Use `base64.b64encode()` instead of `base64.encodestring()` in Twisted
  client. (Mihai Ibanescu)

* Fix missing `CIMDateTime` import in Twisted client.  (Mihai Ibanescu)

* Fixed `CIMInstanceName` rendering to string. It is now possible to pass the
  rendered string value as an instance path argument of a CIM method.
  (Jan Safranek, Michal Minar)

* For Python providers, fixed the comparsion of the Role parameter in
  association operations to be case insensitive, and removed an erroneous
  test that raised an exception when the property specified in the Role
  parameter was not also in the property list specified by the Properties
  parameter.  (Jan Safranek)

* For Python providers, converted debug 'print' statements to trace
  messages that end up in the system log.  (Jan Safranek)

* The CIM-XML parser no longer throws an exception when parsing a
  qualifier declaration.
  Note: The CIM-XML supported by this fix does not conform to DSP0201 so
  far. Further fixes are pending.  (Jan Safranek)

* Fixed parsing errors for connection URLs with IPv6 addresses, including
  zone indexes (aka scope IDs).  (Peter Hatina, Andreas Maier)

* Fixed the hard coded socket addressing family used for HTTPS that was
  incorrect in some IPv6 cases, by determining it dynamically.
  (Peter Hatina)

* Fixed the list of output parameters of extrinsic method calls to be
  returned as a case insensitive dictionary (using `cim_obj.NocaseDict`).
  (Jan Safranek)

* Fixed the checking of CIMVERSION attributes in CIM-XML to only verify the
  major version, consistent with DSP0201 (see subclause 5.2.1, in DSP0201
  version 2.3.1).  (Jan Safranek)

* Fixed error in cim_http.py related to stronger type checking of Python
  2.7. (Eduardo de Barros Lima)

* Removed erroneous qualifier scopes SCHEMA and QUALIFIER from the MOF
  compiler (see DSP0004).  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed debug logging of CIM-XML payload (that is, `conn.last_*request/reply`
  attributes) for extrinsic method calls, to now be consistent with
  intrinsic method calls.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) error when validating peer's
  certificate.  (Michal Minar)

* Added a check in the `CIMInstanceName` constructor that the `classname`
  argument is not None.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed the issue in the `CIMProperty` constructor that specifying a tuple
  for the `value` argument was incorrectly detected to be a scalar (and not
  an array).  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed the issue in the `CIMProperty` constructor that specifying a
  `datetime` or `timedelta` typed value resulted in storing the provided
  object in the `value` attribute, instead of converting it to a
  `CIMDateTime` object.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed the issue in the `CIMProperty` constructor that specifying a datetime
  formatted string typed `value` argument along with `type='datetime'`
  resulted in storing the provided string object in the `value` attribute,
  instead of converting it to a `CIMDateTime` object.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed several cases in the `CIMProperty` constructor of unnecessarily
  requiring the optional arguments `type`, `is_array`, `embedded_object`,
  or `reference_class`. These optional arguments are now only necessary to
  be provided if they cannot be implied from provided arguments (mainly
  from `value`).  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed the issue in the `CIMProperty` constructor that an `embedded_object`
  argument value of 'object' was changed to 'instance' when a `CIMInstance`
  typed `value` argument was also provided.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed the issue in the `CIMProperty` constructor that the first array
  element was used for defaulting the `type` attribute, without checking
  that for None, causing an exception to be raised in this case.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Added a check in the `CIMProperty` constructor that the `name` argument is
  not None.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed the issue that the `CIMProperty` constructor raised only `TypeError`
  even when the issue was not about types; it now raises in addition
  `ValueError`.  (Andreas Maier)

* Changed the exception that is raised in `NocaseDict.__setitem__()` for
  invalid key types, to be `TypeError` in instead of `KeyError`. Updated the
  testcases accordingly.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added checks for more than one argument and for unsupported argument
  types to the constructor of `NocaseDict`.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed incorrectly labeled namespace variables in twisted client.
  (Robert Booth)

* Fixed that `WBEMConnection.last_raw_reply` was not set to the current reply
  in case of parsing errors in the reply.  (Andreas Maier)

* Reintroduced Python 2.6 support in `cim_http.HTTPSConnection.connect()`
  that disappeared in early drafts of this version: (Andreas Maier)

  - Removed `SSLTimeoutError` from except list; being a subclass of
    `SSLError`, it is catched via `SSLError`.
  - Invoked `socket.create_connection()` without source_address, if running
    on Python 2.6.

* Fixed bug where HTTP body was attempted ot be read when CIMError header
  is set, causing a hang.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added CIM-XML declaration support for alternative PyWBEM client based
  on twisted.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for Windows to wbemcli.py, by making dependency on HOME
  environment variable optional, and adding HOMEPATH environment variable.
  Also, cleaned up the global namespace of wbemcli.py and made it
  importable as a module.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed errors in generated MOF (e.g. in any `tomof()` methods): (Andreas Maier)

  - Missing backslash escaping within string literals for `\n`, `\r`, `\t`,
    `\"`.
  - Representation of REF types was incorrect.
  - '=' in array-typed qualifier declarations was missing.
  - Fixed size indicator was missing in array elements.
  - Qualifiers of method parameters were missing.

* Improvements in generated MOF: (Andreas Maier)

  - Changed order of qualifiers to be sorted by qualifier name.
  - Added empty line before each property and method in the class for
    better readability.
  - Method parameters are now placed on separate lines.
  - Moved generation of method qualifiers from class into method. This
    changes the behavior of `CIMMethod.tomof()` to now generate the method
    qualifiers.

* Fixed error where invoking mof_compiler.py with a file based URL that
  did not start with 'file:' failed with an undefined variable `url_` in
  cim_http.py. Issue #1 on GitHub.  (Klaus Kaempf, Andreas Maier)

* Fixed build error that raised a `YaccError` in mof_compiler.py:
  "Syntax error. Expected ':'". Issue #2 on GitHub.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed issue where MOF compiler did not find include files with
  a path specified. Issue #4 on GitHub.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

* Added missing `LocalOnly` parameter to `EnumerateInstances()` of
  the wbemcli script. Issue #33 on GitHub.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

* Added workaround for Python 2.6 for Python issue 15881.

* Removed the lex.py and yacc.py files from PyWBEM, and used them from the
  `ply` package, which is their real home. This fixes a number of issues
  because the latest version is now used. Issue #8 on GitHub.i
  (Karl Schopmeyer)

* Fixed the issue that the LEX and YACC table modules were regenerated
  under certain conditions.  Issue #55 on GitHub.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

* Fixed bugs in the mof_compiler script.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

* Fixed errors in the description of the qualifier operations in
  `WBEMConnection`.  Issue #91 on GitHub.  (Andreas Maier)

**Testing:**

* Added support for running the unit test cases without having to be in the
  testsuite directory. This was done by setting up the DTD_FILE path
  correctly for any XML tests.  (Andreas Maier)

* Improved the quality of assertion messages issued when testcases fail, to
  include context information and types.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added docstrings to test cases.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added testcases for `CIMProperty.__init__()` to be comprehensive.
  (Andreas Maier)

* In XML validation tests, added the expected XML root element.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Added a header to any error messages issued by xmllint.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fix: Merged stderr into stdout for the xmllint invocation, xmllint error
  messages go to stderr and had been dropped before.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fix: The "mkdir -p ..:" command in the comfychair testcase constructor
  created subdirectories named "-p" when running on Windows; replaced that
  command with `os.makedirs()`.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fix: Replaced the "rm -fr ..." command in the comfychair testcase
  constructor with `shutil.rmtree()`, in order to better run on Windows.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Fix: In `comfychair._enter_rundir()`, moved registration of cleanup
  function `_restore_directory()` to the end, so cleanup happens only if no
  errors happened.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed a bug in `pywbem/trunk/testsuite/test_tupleparse.py` in function
  `ParseCIMProperty.runtest()`, where the use of real tab characters caused
  a few lines to be incorrectly indented, and as a result, ignored for the
  test.  (Andreas Maier)

* Improved Windows portability in testsuite: Moved from using the Unix-only
  functions `posix.WIFSIGNALED()` and `posix.WEXITSTATUS()` for testing the
  success of `subprocess.wait()`, to simply testing for 0.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added ability to invoke `test_cim_operations.py` with comfychair arguments,
  and added printing of exception information if an operation fails.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Migrated from comfychair to py.test, standard Python unittest, and to
  tox.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added `test_client.py` with a few initial testcases. This is an end-to-end
  test concept that allows specifying test cases that cover the entire
  PyWBEM Client top to bottom. It mocks the socket layer and allows
  specifying the test cases in YAML, starting with input at the PyWBEM
  Client API (e.g. an operation and its parameters), the expected CIM-XML
  request at the socket payload level resulting from this input (the
  request is verified), the CIM-XML response that is to be generated,
  and finally an expected result at the PyWBEM Client API that is being
  verified.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added use of Travis CI test environment. Commits to GitHub now trigger
  test runs on the Travis CI. A badge on the GitHub README page shows
  the current test result of the master branch, and links to the Travis
  site for the test results of the branches of any pull requests.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for reporting test coverage, using the Python 'coverage'
  package. Coverage is reported on stdout as part of testing, e.g. with
  'make test' for the current Python environment, or with 'tox' for all
  supported Python environments.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added multiple tests for client connection timeout. A mock test was added
  for both HTTP and HTTPs.  However, this causes an error in python 2 with
  HTTPS so two new options were added to test_client.py. First, a new
  parameter ignore_python_version was added to the yaml to define a major
  version of python for which a particulare testcase would be ignored.  Second
  a non-documente option was added to test_client.py to execute a single
  testcase if the name of that testcase is the only parameter on the
  test_client.py cmd line.
  Finally a whole new run_operationtimeout.py file was added to testsuite to
  throughly test for timeouts. This runs ONLY against particular versions of
  OpenPegasus because it required adding a new method to OpenPegasus. However,
  it established that the timeouts apparently now really do work in both
  python 2 and python 3 with both http and https. (see issue #363)

**Clean Code:**

* Removed dangerous default parameter `{}` from `CIMProperty` and
  `CIMInstanceName`, and replaced it with `None`. To support that, added
  support for initializing an empty `NocaseDict` object from `None`.
  (Andreas Maier)

* In cim_obj, changed the use of the deprecated backticks to using `%r` in
  the format string (which produces the same result).  (Andreas Maier)

* In the constructor of `CIMInstanceName`, added assertions to some paths
  that cannot possibly be taken based on the fact that the keybindings
  attribute is always a `NocaseDict`. They should be removed at some point.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Addressed PyLint issues: (Andreas Maier, Karl Schopmeyer)

  - Consolidated imports at the top of the module (after module docstring),
    consistent with the PEP-8 recommendation.
  - Ensured order of imports: standard, non-standard, pywbem, local (on a
    subset of modules only).
  - Replaced wildcard imports with specific imports, as much as possible.
  - Removed unused imports.
  - Addressed PyLint issues that are related to whitespace, continuation
    indentation, and line length.
  - Replaced all real tab characters with spaces.
  - Many more PyLint issues

**Packaging / Build:**

* Fixed grammatical funkiness in the license text.  No change to actual
  license - still LGPLv2.  (Tim Potter)

* Added LICENSE.txt file to release.  (Tim Potter)

* Added LICENSE.txt, NEWS, README and INSTALL files to distribution
  archive.  (Andreas Maier)

* Fixed inconsistencies in license text in file headers to consistently
  say LGPL 2.1 or higher (The LICENSE.txt file has always been LGPL 2.1).
  (Andreas Maier)

* Removed confusing section about build from INSTALL file, to scope it just
  to the topic of installation.  (Andreas Maier)

* Restructured pywbem/trunk subtree to move pywbem package files into a
  pywbem subdirectory.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added a makefile (invoke 'make help' for valid targets).  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for checking the Python source code using PyLint.
  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for generating HTML documentation using epydoc, and
  included the documentation into the distribution archive. The syntax
  used in Python docstrings is reStructuredText markdown.   (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for installing OS-level prerequisites via the new setup.py
  script commands 'install_os' and 'develop_os'.  (Andreas Maier)

* Added support for installing Python-level prerequisites when installing
  in development mode using the setup.py script command 'develop'.
  (Andreas Maier)


pywbem 0.7.0
------------

Released: 2008-12-12

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed enumInstances and references in cim_provider to do a deep
  copy of the model before filtering instances so provider writers
  are less surprised.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Added `CIMDateTime.__cmp__()` so that `CIMDateTime` instances can be
  compared.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed data types of method return values for python providers.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed REF array out parameters in tupleparse.py.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed Array parameters with no elements.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed precision for real32 and real64 types.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed Array properties where is_array isn't set in `__init__`.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Added `NocaseDict.__cmp__(self, other)`.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed `WBEMConnection.__repr__` for anonymous connections. (Tim Potter)

* Fixed XML encoding of `CIMQualifierDeclarations`.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed `EnumerateQualifiers` if there are no qualifiers.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fixed `InvokeMethod` to only send a LOCALCLASSPATH or LOCALINSTANCEPATH,
  not a CLASSPATH or INSTANCEPATH.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fix unexpected line break in basic auth header for long
  credentials.  (Daniel Hiltgen)

* Fix Host: HTTP header when connecting to a unix domain socket.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fix deprecation warnings with Python 2.6.  (Bart Whiteley)

**Enhancements:**

* Added support for generating Pegasus provider registration MOF in
  `cim_provider.codegen()`. (Bart Whiteley)

* Implemented methods to parse indication export requests.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Python provider code generation enhancements.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Support for Pegasus Local authentication.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Support for Pegasus and OpenWBEM Unix Domain Socket.  (Tim and Bart)

* Added support for Pegasus non-compliant EMBEDDEDOBJECT XML attribute.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Added `CIMQualifierDeclaration.tomof()`.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Added a powerful MOF compiler.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Added property filtering to `CIMInstance`.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Added value attribute to `CIMParameter`.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Rigged CIMInstance to automagically update `CIMInstance.path.keybindings`
  as key properties are set.  (Bart Whiteley)

* Added cim_provider2.py: A new provider interface.  Python providers
  using this interface can use the cmpi-bindings project within OMC
  (https://omc-project.org/) to run under any CIMOM supporting the
  CMPI interface.  This is prefered to the old cim_provider.py interface
  that was used with the Python Provider Managers for OpenWBEM and Pegasus.

* Changed `__init__.py` to not import anything from `cim_provider.py` (or
  `cim_provider2.py`) into the pywbem namespace.  Existing providers based
  on `cim_provider.py` can still work with a minor adjustment involving
  importing `CIMProvider` from `pywbem.cim_provider`.  The codegen funtion
  can now be obtained with `from pywbem.cim_provider import codegen`, or
  `from pywbem.cim_provider2 import codegen` or similar.

* Added `wbemcli.py` command line utility.  (Tim Potter)

* Pass keyword args in unix domain socket connection functions down to
  `WBEMConnection()`.  (Tim Potter)


pywbem 0.6
----------

Released: 2007-10-26 (not on Pypi)

**Licensing:**

* Relicensed from the GNU GPLv2 to the GNU LGPLv2.

**API Changes:**

* Add a type keyword arg and attribute to `CIMQualifier`, similar to
  the `CIMProperty` object, to allow the creation of null qualifiers.
  (Tim Potter)

* Remove the `toxml()` method from CIM object classes.  Use
  `tocimxml().toxml()` instead which specifies the CIM-XML
  representation of the object. (Tim Potter)

* `CIMDateTime` class should now be used instead of `datetime.datetime`
  and `datetime.timedelta`.

* Added a new method, `CIMInstance.update_existing()`.  This behaves
  like `update()` on a dict, but only assigns new values to existing
  properties.  It skips values for properties not already present
  in the instance.  This is useful for honoring PropertyList within
  python providers.

**Bug fixes:**

* Explicitly specify charset="utf-8" in HTTP Content-type header
  as this is required now by the Pegasus cimserver.  (Tim Potter)

* Parse VALUETYPE elements that contain a TYPE attribute.  This
  feature was introduced in version 2.2 of the CIM-XML DTD and
  produced by some CIMOMs such as the Java WBEM Server.  (Tim Potter)

* Don't require `CreateInstance` to have the path attribute set but
  if it is, use the namespace from it.  (Tim Potter)

* Allow extrinsic methods to return object references.  (Tim Potter)

* Fix `CIMInstanceName` to support more numeric types of keybindings.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Fix datetime values to support utc offset. (Bart Whiteley)

* Fix http client to monitor the connection more closely (RFC 2616
  section 8.2.2).  Previously, a large request could cause a socket
  exception with no ability to read the response and respond to
  an authentication challenge.

* Fix NULL qualifiers to have a (required) type. (Martin Mrazik)

* Fix initialising `CIMInstanceName` keys from a `NocaseDict`. (Bart
  Whiteley)

* Return correct namespace in path for return value from
  `GetInstance`. (Tim Potter)

* Numerous bugfixes to Twisted Python client. (Tim Potter)

* Fix for x.509 SSL certificate handling. (Bas ten Berge)

* `EnumerateClassNames()` now returns an empty list instead of None
  if there are no classes. (Bart Whiteley)

**Enhancements:**

* Support for OpenWBEM password-less local authentication.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Support for embedded objects is described in DSP0201-2.2.0
  (Bart Whiteley)

* New `CIMDateTime` class to deal with CIM-isms of datetimes.
  Most notably, datetime deals with timezone info poorly.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Add `InvokeMethod()` support in Twisted Python client. (Tim
  Potter)


pywbem 0.5
----------

Released: 2006-11-21 (not on Pypi)

**API Changes:**

* Many API changes were made to simplify the function and object
  interface of PyWBEM.  Aspects of just about every CIM operation
  call and CIM object have changed.  The major changes are:

  - The "LocalNamespacePath" keyword argument has been renamed to
    simply "namespace" for all CIM operations.

  - Replaced all object location classes with `CIMInstanceName`, and
    all instance classes with `CIMInstance`.  `CIMInstanceName` now
    has "host" and "namespace" attributes to fully name a
    reference to an instance.  The `CIMInstance` class now has a
    "path" attribute which is of type `CIMInstanceName`.

  - `EnumerateInstances()` now returns a list of `CIMInstance` objects
    (with path attribute set) instead of a list of
    `CIMNamedInstance` or tuples of `(CIMInstanceName, CIMInstance)`.

  - All representations of properties can now be represented with
    the `CIMProperty` class.

* All classes now have a `copy()` method which return a deep copy of
  the object.  PyWBEM makes extensive use of dictionary objects
  which are passed by reference in Python.  Use the `copy()` method
  to create and manipulate objects without modifying them by
  accident.

**Bug fixes:**

* Fix parse bug when a `CIMInstanceName` is passed as the
  localobject parameter to `WBEMConnection.InvokeMethod()`.

* Fix parsing of INSTANCE elements containing PROPERTY.REFERENCE
  elements bug found by Bart Whiteley.  This turns up when
  processing associations. (Tim Potter)

* Handle extrinsic method calls that don't return a value or any
  output parameters. (Tim Potter)

* Fixed parsing of PARAMETER.ARRAY and PARAMETER.REFARRAY to
  not require optional attrs. (Bart Whiteley)

* Atomic_to_cim_xml string generation for a datetime - was missing
  a >> '.' in the string. (Norm Paxton)

* `InvokeMethod` did not provide for `None` in output parameters.
  (Norm Paxton)

**Enhancements:**

* More parts of the class provider interface have been
  implemented.  (Tim Potter, Bart Whiteley)

* Many case-sensitivity bugs, mostly in `__cmp__` methods, were
  found and fixed.  (Tim Potter)

* Implemented a test suite for maintaining backward compatibility
  and testing new features.  (Tim Potter)

* Implemented ExecQuery. (Bart Whiteley)

* Allow a string classname to be passed as the localobject
  parameter to `WBEMConnection.InvokeMethod()`. (Tim Potter)

* Add missing qualifiers on array properties. (Bart Whiteley)

* Added code for performing asynchronous WBEM client operations
  using the Twisted Python framework. (Tim Potter)

* Allow extrinsic method calls that take parameters. (Tim Potter)

* Added `cim_http.AuthError` exception class.  This is raised if the
  CIMOM returns a 401 (Unauthorized).  Now the client can
  distinguish this condition, and (re)prompt for credentials.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Created `cim_obj.CIMParameter` class.  Added return type,
  class origin, propagated to `CIMMethod`.  `CIMParameter` object
  now allows parameter types and qualifiers to be obtained.
  (Bart Whiteley)

* Implemented case-insensitive keys for property and qualifier
  dictionaries, as per the CIM specification.  (Tim Potter, Bart
  Whitely)


pywbem 0.4
----------

Released: 2005-11-15 (not on Pypi)

**Bug fixes:**

* Correctly calculate value of Content-Length HTTP header to include
  opening XML stanza. (Szalai Ferenc)

* Fix syntax error when re-raising socket errors. (Pat Knight)

**Enhancements:**

* Support for marshaling and unmarshaling CIM dates object into
  Python datetime objects. (Szalai Ferenc)

* Experimental module for making asynchronous WBEM calls with
  PyWBEM in Twisted Python. (Tim Potter)

* Add parameter type checking for object location classes. (Tim
  Potter)

* Allow caller to pass in a dictionary containing the location of
  the SSL certificate and key files as per the httplib.HTTPSConnection()
  class constructor. (Pat Knight)

**API Changes:**

* Change association provider API functions to take a fixed
  parameter for the named object instead of a keyword argument.
  This breaks backward compatibility. (Tim Potter)

* Remove the `CIMLocalNamespacePath` class and replaced by a Python
  string. (Tim Potter)

**Portability:**

* Don't use `UserDict.DictMixin` base class as it only exists in
  Python 2.3 and higher. (Tim Potter)

**Tests:**

* Add tests for parameter type checking for object location
  classes. (Tim Potter)

* Add tests for string representation of object location classes.
  (Tim Potter)
