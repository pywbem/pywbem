#
# Generally package vulnerabilites listed in the ignore-vulnerabilities
# list below are there because:
# 1. There is no release that resolves the vulnerability.  In this case, there
#    should also be an expire entry to remind the pywbem team to recheck
# 2. The required version of a package to resolve the issue is not available
#    for all of the python version supported by pywbem. In that case, the
#    vulnerability will remain ignored until such time as the versions of
#    python that cannot support the required version of the package are no
#    longer supported by pywbem.
#
# The way to see python version limitations for package versions
#    as defined for pywbem is to filter the file minimum-constraints.txt
#    for the package name. Multiple entries for same package name imply
#    different minimum versions for different python releases.

# Configuration for the 'safety check' command
security:

    # Ignore certain severities.
    # A number between 0 and 10, with the following significant values:
    # - 9: ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL severity
    # - 7: ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL & HIGH severity
    # - 4: ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL, HIGH & MEDIUM severity
    ignore-cvss-severity-below: 0

    # Ignore unknown severities.
    # Should be set to False.

    # List of specific vulnerabilities to ignore.
    # {id}:                 # vulnerability ID
    #     reason: {text}    # optional: Reason for ignoring it. Will be reported in the Safety reports
    #     expires: {date}   # optional: Date when this ignore will expire
