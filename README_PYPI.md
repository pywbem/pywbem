Pywbem is a WBEM client and WBEM indication listener and provides related WBEM
client-side functionality. It is written in pure Python and runs on Python 2 and
Python 3.

WBEM is a standardized approach for systems management defined by the
[DMTF](https://www.dmtf.org) that is used in the industry for a wide variety of
systems management tasks. See
[WBEM Standards](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem) for more information. An
important use of this approach is the
[SMI-S](https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/smi)
standard defined by [SNIA](https://www.snia.org) for managing storage.

A WBEM client allows issuing operations to a WBEM server for the purpose of
performing systems management tasks. A WBEM indication listener is used to wait
for and process notifications emitted by a WBEM server for the purpose of
systems management.
