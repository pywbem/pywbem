# Additional pip requirements file for pywbem testing.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Direct dependencies (just for "setup.py test")


# Unit test (imports into testcases):
packaging>=17.0
funcsigs>=1.0.2; python_version < '3.3'
# pytest 5.0.0 has removed support for Python < 3.5
# pytest 4.3.1 solves an issue on Python 3 with minimum package levels
# pytest==6.0.0 causes pylint to report "not-callable" issues
# pytest>=6.0.0 causes pylint to report "abstract-method" issues
# For both, see https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7591

# Lxml
# lxml 4.4.0 removed Python 3.4 support.
# lxml 4.4.1 added Python 3.8 support. However, while providing binary wheel
#   files, it did not register Python 3.8 as a supported version in the
#   package metadata on Pypi. A fix for that is expected for the next lxml
#   version after 4.4.2 (See https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1854465
#   and https://github.com/lxml/lxml/pull/291). Before that, pip 19.3.1
#   is required to properly deal with this inconsistency (see issue #1980).
