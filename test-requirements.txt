# Pip requirements file for test dependencies.

# These dependencies have been separated from the other development dependencies
# in dev-requirements.txt in order to be able to run tests from just the
# source archive using 'setup.py test', without having the rest of the files
# in the repo.


# Direct dependencies for test and indirect dependencies for test that are
# needed for some reason (must be consistent with minimum-constraints-develop.txt)
