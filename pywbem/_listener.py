*New in pywbem 0.9 as experimental and finalized in 0.10.*

The :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener` class provides a thread-based WBEM listener
service that can receive CIM indications from multiple WBEM servers and that
calls registered callback functions to deliver the received indications.

The listener receives indications from an indication sender, validates the
formatting of the indication and queues each received indication into an
interprocess queue (`indication queue`). A seperate thread monitors this
queue and calls registered callback functions for each indication in the queue.

This insures that timing in the callback functions does not interfere with the
reception of indications from the indication sender.

Examples
--------

The following example creates and runs a listener::

    import logging
    from pywbem import WBEMListener

    def process_indication(indication, host):
        '''This function gets called when an indication is received.'''

        print(f"Received CIM indication from {host}: {indication!r}")

    def main():

        # Configure logging of the listener via the Python root logger
        logging.basicConfig(
            filename='listener.log', level=logging.WARNING,
            format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

        certkeyfile = 'listener.pem'

        # Set host name to wildcard host address to recieve indications on
        # any network address defined for this system.
        listener = WBEMListener(host="",
                                http_port=5990,
                                https_port=5991,
                                certfile=certkeyfile,
                                keyfile=certkeyfile)
        listener.add_callback(process_indication)

        try:
            listener.start()

            # process_indication() will be called for each received indication

            . . .  # wait for some condition to end listening

        finally:
            listener.stop()

Alternative code using the class as a context manager::

    with WBEMListener(...) as listener:
        listener.add_callback(process_indication)
        listener.start()

        # process_indication() will be called for each received indication

        ... # wait for some condition to end listening

    # listener.stop() has been called automatically

See the example in section :ref:`WBEMSubscriptionManager` for an example of
using a listener in combination with a subscription manager.

Another listener example is in the script ``examples/listen.py`` (when you
clone the GitHub pywbem/pywbem project). It is an interactive Python shell that
creates a listener and displays any indications it receives, in MOF format.


.. _`Logging in the listener`:

Logging in the listener
-----------------------

Each :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener` object has its own separate Python logger
object with the name:

  `'pywbem.listener.{id}'`

where `{id}` is a string that is unique for each :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener`
object within the Python process.

The :attr:`~pywbem.WBEMListener.logger` property of a
:class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener` object provides access to that Python logger
object, if needed.

The listener will log any indications it receives and any responses it sends
back to the indication sender, at the ``INFO`` logging level
(see :ref:`py:levels`).

In addition, it will log errors at the ``ERROR`` logging level.

The Python root logger will by default (i.e. when not being configured) print
log records of logging level ``WARNING`` or greater to `sys.stderr`. So the
indication and response interactions will not be printed by default, but any
errors logged at the ``ERROR`` logging level will be printed by default.

Listener indication flood
-------------------------

The pywbem listener processes indications through an interprocess queue
(`indication queue`) between the listener thread that receives the
indication over the network and the callback thread in which the user-provided
callback function runs.

If the callback processing takes longer, indications can pile up in the
indication queue. While this is not normally an issue, a flood of indications
from the sender could result in more indications in the queue than the memory
of the listener can support.

The handling of this situation in pywbem has improved over time:

* Before pywbem 1.8.0, the indication queue had no size limit, and grew
  larger until memory limits were reached.

* Starting with pywbem 1.8.0, the :class:`pywbem.WBEMListener` class added
  an optional init parameter ``max_ind_queue_size`` to specify a size limit
  for the indication queue. When the size limit was reached, the listener and
  callback threads terminated and the :meth:`pywbem.WBEMListener.start` method
  raised :exc:`pywbem.ListenerQueueFullError`. No CIM-XML error response was
  sent back to the sender for the indication that caused the queue to become
  full.
  This approach was meant to protect from memory full conditions but had the
  drawback that the listener stopped and the sender got no information as to
  why that happened.

* Starting with pywbem 1.9.0, the behavior has been improved: When the size
  limit of the indication queue is reached, the indication is not put into the
  queue, a CIM-XML error response with status
  :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_FAILED` is sent back to the sender and
  the listener and callback threads continue to run. As a result, no exception
  indicating that the queue is full is raised anymore from the
  :meth:`pywbem.WBEMListener.start` method. For backwards compatibility
  reasons, the :exc:`pywbem.ListenerQueueFullError` exception is still defined
  (but is no longer raised). In addition, the default for the
  ``max_ind_queue_size`` input parameter has been changed from 0 (unlimited) to
  a reasonable limit.

The following example creates and runs a listener::

    import logging
    from pywbem import WBEMListener

    def process_indication(indication, host):
        '''This function gets called when an indication is received.'''

        print(f"Received CIM indication from {host}: {indication!r}")

    def main():

        # Configure logging of the listener via the Python root logger
        logging.basicConfig(
            filename='listener.log', level=logging.WARNING,
            format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

        certkeyfile = 'listener.pem'

        # Set host name to wildcard host address to recieve indications on
        # any network address defined for this system.
        listener = WBEMListener(host="",
                                http_port=5990,
                                https_port=5991,
                                certfile=certkeyfile,
                                keyfile=certkeyfile)
        listener.add_callback(process_indication)

        listener.start()

        # process_indication() will be called for each received indication

        . . .  # wait for some condition to end listening

        listener.stop()

    A WBEM listener.

    The listener supports starting and stopping threads that listen for
    CIM-XML ExportIndication messages using HTTP and/or HTTPS, and that pass
    any received indications on to registered callback functions.

    The listener must be stopped in order to free the TCP/IP port it listens
    on. Using this class as a context manager ensures that the listener is
    stopped when leaving the context manager scope.

    The listener validates the syntax of the received CIM instance but does not
    validate the values of received the MESSAGE_ID or SEQUENCE_NUMBER of
    incoming indications. Therefore, it does not know if any indications are
    missing from a sequence. The callback function must do any such
    processing., etc. that confirms if indications are in the proper sequence
    and none were lost.

        """
        Parameters:

          host (:term:`string`):
            IP address or host name to which this listener is bound (i.e. at
            which this listener can be reached).  If a listener is bound to a
            particular IP address it will only receive indications addressed to
            that IP address (or to any IP address on the network interface
            containing that address) depending on the OS.

            Network wildcard addressing enables receiving indications from
            all IP addresses on the system by binding the listener to certain
            special addresses. The IPV4 wildcard IP address is "0.0.0.0"
            and the IPV6 wildcard IP address is "::".
            Setting the host parameter to an empty string (i.e. "") is
            equivalent to using the wildcard address with the default
            IP addressing family.

          http_port (:term:`string` or :term:`integer`):
            HTTP port at which this listener can be reached. At
            least one port (HTTP or HTTPS) must be set. Both the http and
            https ports can be set.

            `None` means not to set up a port for HTTP.

          https_port (:term:`string` or :term:`integer`):
            HTTPS port at which this listener can be reached.

            `None` means not to set up a port for HTTPS.

          certfile (:term:`string`):
            File path of certificate file to be used as server certificate
            during SSL/TLS handshake when creating the secure HTTPS connection.

            It is valid for the certificate file to contain a private key; the
            server certificate sent during SSL/TLS handshake is sent without
            the private key.

            `None` means not to use a server certificate file. Setting up a port
            for HTTPS requires specifying a certificate file.

          keyfile (:term:`string`):
            File path of private key file to be used by the server during
            SSL/TLS handshake when creating the secure HTTPS connection.

            It is valid to specify a certificate file that contains a private
            key.

            `None` means not to use a private key file. Setting up a port
            for HTTPS requires specifying a private key file.

          max_ind_queue_size (:term:`integer`):
            A positive integer which defines the maximum size of the indication
            queue. If an indication is received and the queue is full, the
            indication is not put into the queue and a CIM-XML response
            with status :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_FAILED` is sent
            back to the sender, indicating that the indication could not be
            accepted. The listener and callback threads continue to run.

            A value of 0 indicates that the queue has no maximum size. In this
            case, the queue size will grow as needed (until the listener
            process is out of memory), and all indications will be accepted.

            For a reliable operation of the listener, it is recommended to
            define a maximum queue size.

        Raises:

          TypeError: port, max_ind_queue_size arguments invalid type.

        When the WBEM listener is started, first the callback thread is started
        that will lateron call the registered callback functions for each
        indication that is received. Then, the listener threads for HTTP and
        HTTPS are started (depending on which ports have been specified) to
        enable the receiving of indications from a sender.

        The listener threads will handle the CIM-XML ExportIndication export
        message described in :term:`DSP0200` and they will put each indication
        received into the indication queue of the WBEM listener. The callback
        thread will get the indications from the queue and will pass them to
        registered callback functions.

        The listener must be stopped by the user in order to free the TCP/IP
        ports it listens on. The listener can be stopped explicitly using the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMListener.stop` method. The listener will be
        automatically stopped when the main thread terminates (i.e. when the
        Python process terminates), or when :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener`
        is used as a context manager when leaving its scope.

        In case of HTTPS, the private key file and certificate file are used.
        If the private key file is protected with a password, the password
        will be prompted for using :func:`py:getpass.getpass`. If the password
        is invalid, or if the private key file or certificate file are invalid,
        :exc:`pywbem.ListenerCertificateError` is raised.

        threads are cleaned up again.
