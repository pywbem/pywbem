*New in pywbem 0.9 as experimental and finalized in 0.10.*

The :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener` class provides a thread-based WBEM listener
service that can receive CIM indications from multiple WBEM servers and that
calls registered callback functions to deliver the received indications.

The listener receives indications from an indication sender, validates the
formtting of the indication and queues each received indication into an
interprocess queue. A seperate thread monitors this queue and calls the
callback functions for each indication in the queue.

This insures that timing in the callback functions does not interfere with the
reception of indications from the indication sender.

Examples
--------

The following example creates and runs a listener::

    import logging
    from pywbem import WBEMListener

    def process_indication(indication, host):
        '''This function gets called when an indication is received.'''

        print(f"Received CIM indication from {host}: {indication!r}")

    def main():

        # Configure logging of the listener via the Python root logger
        logging.basicConfig(
            filename='listener.log', level=logging.WARNING,
            format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

        certkeyfile = 'listener.pem'

        # Set host name to wildcard host address to recieve indications on
        # any network address defined for this system.
        listener = WBEMListener(host="",
                                http_port=5990,
                                https_port=5991,
                                certfile=certkeyfile,
                                keyfile=certkeyfile)
        listener.add_callback(process_indication)

        try:
            listener.start()

            # process_indication() will be called for each received indication

            . . .  # wait for some condition to end listening

        finally:
            listener.stop()

Alternative code using the class as a context manager::

    with WBEMListener(...) as listener:
        listener.add_callback(process_indication)
        listener.start()

        # process_indication() will be called for each received indication

        ... # wait for some condition to end listening

    # listener.stop() has been called automatically

See the example in section :ref:`WBEMSubscriptionManager` for an example of
using a listener in combination with a subscription manager.

Another listener example is in the script ``examples/listen.py`` (when you
clone the GitHub pywbem/pywbem project). It is an interactive Python shell that
creates a listener and displays any indications it receives, in MOF format.


.. _`Logging in the listener`:

Logging in the listener
-----------------------

Each :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener` object has its own separate Python logger
object with the name:

  `'pywbem.listener.{id}'`

where `{id}` is a string that is unique for each :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener`
object within the Python process.

The :attr:`~pywbem.WBEMListener.logger` property of a
:class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener` object provides access to that Python logger
object, if needed.

The listener will log any indications it receives and any responses it sends
back to the indication sender, at the ``INFO`` logging level
(see :ref:`py:levels`).

In addition, it will log errors at the ``ERROR`` logging level.

The Python root logger will by default (i.e. when not being configured) print
log records of logging level ``WARNING`` or greater to `sys.stderr`. So the
indication and response interactions will not be printed by default, but any
errors logged at the ``ERROR`` logging level will be printed by default.

Listener indication flood
-------------------------

A listener processes indications through an interprocess queue so a flood of
indications from the indication sender where the callback processing was taking
longer than indication reception could over time result in indications piling
up in the received indication queue. While this is not normally an issue a
flood of indications from the sender could result in more indications in the
queue than the memory of the client can support. Effective with version 1.8.0,
an optional argument was added to the listener initialization
(max_ind_queue_size) that causes generation of an exception
(ListenerQueueFullError) and stopping of sending indication reception. Since
this effectively stops the listener, it should only be used if the number of
indications in the queue is a threat to the memory in the client, not for
temporary slowdown of the flow of indications from the indication sender.

It closes the listener connections and  either discards indications in the queue
or .

The following example creates and runs a listener::

    import logging
    from pywbem import WBEMListener

    def process_indication(indication, host):
        '''This function gets called when an indication is received.'''

        print(f"Received CIM indication from {host}: {indication!r}")

    def main():

        # Configure logging of the listener via the Python root logger
        logging.basicConfig(
            filename='listener.log', level=logging.WARNING,
            format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

        certkeyfile = 'listener.pem'

        # Set host name to wildcard host address to recieve indications on
        # any network address defined for this system.
        listener = WBEMListener(host="",
                                http_port=5990,
                                https_port=5991,
                                certfile=certkeyfile,
                                keyfile=certkeyfile,
                                max_ind_queue_size=5000,
                                )
        listener.add_callback(process_indication)

        try:
            listener.start()

            # process_indication() will be called for each received indication

            . . .  # wait for some condition to end listening

        except ListenerQueueFullError:
            print("Indication listener failed. Indication queue full.")
            listener.stop()


        finally:
            listener.stop()

    Context manager that saves and restores the attributes of the terminal that

    getpass() on Linux and macOS modifies the terminal attributes to disable
    the echoing of the typed password, and restores the terminal attributes
    before it returns. However, when the process calling getpass() gets
    terminated with a SIGTERM signal while it waits for getpass() to return,
    then getpass() itself will not restore the terminal settings.

    This context manager improves that behavior by restoring the settings in
    its exit part, and by additionally registering an Python atexit handler
    that restores the settings. There is a check so that the settings are
    restored only once. This performs the restore in some more cases compared
    to the standard getpass() behavior, particularly when the process calling
    getpass() is terminated with a SIGTERM signal.

    of a context manager do *not* get control, see

    *New in pywbem 0.9 as experimental and finalized in 0.10.*

    A WBEM listener.

    The listener supports starting and stopping threads that listen for
    CIM-XML ExportIndication messages using HTTP and/or HTTPS, and that pass
    any received indications on to registered callback functions.

    The listener must be stopped in order to free the TCP/IP port it listens
    on. Using this class as a context manager ensures that the listener is
    stopped when leaving the context manager scope.

    The listener validates the syntax of the received CIM instance but does not
    validate the values of received the MESSAGE_ID or SEQUENCE_NUMBER of
    incoming indications. Therefore, it does not know if any indications are
    missing from a sequence. The callback function must do any such
    processing., etc. that confirms if indications are in the proper sequence
    and none were lost.
    """

    def __init__(self, host, http_port=None, https_port=None,
                 certfile=None, keyfile=None, max_ind_queue_size=0):
        """
        Parameters:

          host (:term:`string`):
            IP address or host name to which this listener is bound (i.e. at
            which this listener can be reached).  If a listener is bound to a
            particular IP address it will only receive indications addressed to
            that IP address (or to any IP address on the network interface
            containing that address) depending on the OS.

            Network wildcard addressing enables receiving indications from
            all IP addresses on the system by binding the listener to certain
            special addresses. The IPV4 wildcard IP address is "0.0.0.0"
            and the IPV6 wild card IP address is "::".

            Setting the host parameter to an empty string (i.e. "") is
            equivalent to using at least the IPV4 wildcard address.

          http_port (:term:`string` or :term:`integer`):
            HTTP port at which this listener can be reached. At
            least one port (HTTP or HTTPS) must be set. Both the http and
            https ports can be set.

            `None` means not to set up a port for HTTP.

          https_port (:term:`string` or :term:`integer`):
            HTTPS port at which this listener can be reached.

            `None` means not to set up a port for HTTPS.

          certfile (:term:`string`):
            File path of certificate file to be used as server certificate
            during SSL/TLS handshake when creating the secure HTTPS connection.

            It is valid for the certificate file to contain a private key; the
            server certificate sent during SSL/TLS handshake is sent without
            the private key.

            `None` means not to use a server certificate file. Setting up a port
            for HTTPS requires specifying a certificate file.

          keyfile (:term:`string`):
            File path of private key file to be used by the server during
            SSL/TLS handshake when creating the secure HTTPS connection.

            It is valid to specify a certificate file that contains a private
            key.

            `None` means not to use a private key file. Setting up a port
            for HTTPS requires specifying a private key file.

          max_ind_queue_size (:term:`integer`):
            A positive integer which defines the maximum number of the received
            indications that can be in the received indication queue.  If the
            queue of received indications reaches this size, the queue is
            blocked and the :exc:`~pywbem.ConnectionError` is raised.

            The default is 0 which disables the test for queue full.

            If set, this should be a large number since the goal is to stop
            receiving indications on the connection and may result in an
            indication receive failure on the WBEM server indication export
            function.

        Raises:

          :exc:`pywbem.ListenerQueueFullError`: if number of
            indications in the listener queue exceeds max_ind_queue_size.

        A interthread queue for holding indications recieved from a server
        thread and a thread for delivering indications from the queue to the
        callback functions are defined and the callback thread is started.

        A thread serving CIM-XML over HTTP is started if an HTTP port was
        specified for the listener. A thread serving CIM-XML over HTTPS is
        started if an HTTPS port was specified for the listener.

        These server threads will handle the ExportIndication export message
        described in :term:`DSP0200` and they will pass each indication
        received to the callback queue.  A separate thread handles passing
        received messages from this queue to the callback functions defined.

        The listener must be stopped again in order to free the TCP/IP port it
        listens on. The listener can be stopped explicitly using the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMListener.stop` method. The listener will be
        automatically stopped when the main thread terminates (i.e. when the
        Python process terminates), or when :class:`~pywbem.WBEMListener`
        is used as a context manager when leaving its scope.

        In case of HTTPS, the private key file and certificate file are used.
        If the private key file is protected with a password, the password
        will be prompted for using :func:`py:getpass.getpass`. If the password
        is invalid, or if the private key file or certificate file are invalid,
        :exc:`pywbem.ListenerCertificateError` is raised.
