pywbem-0.8.4  2016-05-13

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed an IndexError in cim_http.wbem_request() that occurred during
      handling of another exception.

    * Fixed problem that wbemcli in Python 3 when used without existing history
      file would fail with "TypeError: 'FileNotFoundError' object is not
      subscriptable" (issue #302).

    * Fixed issues with Python 3 and HTTPS that were causing the connecttion
      to fail. This completely separates the `connect()` code for Python 3
      (using the Python SSL module) from the code for Python 2 (using
      M2Crypto) (issues #150, #273, #274, #288).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Improved description in INSTALL.md to better describe how to establish
      OS-level prerequisites.

    * Improved Swig installation code by reinstalling Swig if it was installed
      but still cannot be found in PATH (e.g. if the installation was tampered
      with).

    * Removed dependency on git (this was a leftover from when M2Crypto needed
      to be obtained from its development repo).

    * Added debug prints for two probably legitimate situations where socket
      errors are ignored when the server closes or resets the connection.
      These debug prints can be enabled via the `debug` instance variable
      of the WBEMConnection object; they are targeted at development for
      investigating these situations.

    * Added check for minimum Python version 3.4 when running on Python 3.
      That requirement was already documented, now it is also enforced in
      the code.

    * Enhanced the wbemcli script with options supporting certificates.
      For details, invoke with --help, or look at the online documentation.
      NOTE: The --no-ssl and --port options have been removed. Specify
      the protocol and port number in the server URL.

  CLEAN CODE:

    * Removed half-baked code for HTTP proxy/tunneling support.


pywbem-0.8.3  2016-04-15

  BUG FIXES:

    * To address some M2Crypto issues, upgraded to use M2Crypto >=0.24 from
      PyPI.

    * For Windows, using M2CryptoWin32/64 >=0.21 from PyPI, in order to
      avoid the Swig-based build in Windows.

    * Improved the mechanism to build the LEX/YACC table modules, so that
      import errors for freshly installed packages (e.g. M2Crypto) no longer
      occur.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Added Windows versions of WBEM utility commands: wbemcli.bat,
      mof_compiler.bat.


pywbem-0.8.2  2016-03-20

  BUG FIXES:

    * Eliminated dependency on "six" package during installation of pywbem.
      (Andreas Maier)

  DEPENDENCIES:

    * v0.8.x has the following dependencies on other PyPI packages
      (see 'install_requires' argument in setup script):
        - M2Crypto
        - ply
        - six
 

pywbem-0.8.1  2016-03-18

  KNOWN ISSUES:

    * Installing PyWBEM on Python 2.6 has a conflict with the 'pbr' package
      from PyPI, resulting in a TypeError: "dist must be a Distribution
      instance". This issue is specific to Python 2.6 and does not occur in
      any of the other supported Python versions (2.7, 3.4, 3.5). This issue
      can be mitigated by uninstalling the 'pbr' package, or if that is not
      possible, by migrating to Python 2.7. See issue #26 on GitHub.

    * MOF using names that are reserved keywords will fail to compile in the
      MOF compiler. For example, a CIM property named 'indication'. See issue
      #62 on GitHub.

    * The Pulled Enumeration Operations introduced in DSP0200 1.3 are not
      supported in this release. See issue #9 on GitHub.

    * Note that some components of this PyWBEM Client package are still
      considered experimental:
      - The twisted client module twisted_client.py.
      - The Python provider modules cim_provider.py and cim_provider2.py.
      - The CIM indication listener in the `irecv` directory. See issue
        #66 on GitHub. 

  CHANGES:

    * The MOF compiler is now available as the command 'mof_compiler' that gets
      installed into the Python script directory. It is now separate from the
      'mof_compiler' module within the 'pywbem' package. In 0.7.0, the module
      was at the same time the script.  (Andreas Maier)

    * The WBEM client CLI is now available as the command 'wbemcli' that gets
      installed into the Python script directory. It is now separate from the
      'wbemcli' module within the 'pywbem' package. In 0.7.0, the module
      was at the same time the script.  (Andreas Maier)

    * In 0.7.0, most symbols defined in the sub-modules of the 'pywbem' package
      were folded into the 'pywbem' package namespace, cluttering it
      significantly. The symbols in the 'pywbem' package namespace have been
      reduced to a well-defined set that is now declared the external API of
      the WBEM client library, and is supposed to be sufficient. If you find
      that you need something you were used to, please think twice as to
      whether that makes sense to be part of the external PyWBEM API, and if
      so, let us know by opening an issue.

    * Since 0.7.0, some exceptions that can be raised at the external API of
      the WBEM client library have been cleaned up.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Verify certificates against platform provided CA trust store in
      /etc/pki/tls/certs. Linux only.  (Peter Hatina)

    * Added '-d' option to MOF compiler that causes the compiler to perform a
      dry-run and just check the MOF file syntax. This allows to more easily
      detect included MOF files when used together with the '-v' option.
      (Jan Safranek)

    * Added support for non-ASCII (Unicode) characters.  (Michal Minar, Andreas
      Maier)

    * Improved information in the message text of some exceptions (TypeError
      and KeyError in cim_obj.py, ValueError in cim_obj.py, and ParseError in
      tupleparse.py).  (Andreas Maier)

    * Moved the definition of the pywbem version from setup.py to __init__.py,
      in order to make it available to programs using pywbem as
      pywbem.__version__.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for direct iteration over NocaseDict objects using 'for'
      and 'in' by adding __iter__(), e.g. for use with CIMInstance.properties.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Added more instance attributes to be shown in repr() on CIMProperty and
      other classes in cim_obj.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added and improved docstring-based documentation in the pywbem modules
      cim_operations, cim_http, cim_obj, cim_types, and the pywbem module.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Improved the way missing file:// URL support on Windows is handled, by
      now issuing a proper error message instead of stumbling across the
      missing socket.AF_UNIX constant.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Improved the way missing OWLocal authorization with the OpenWBEM server
      is handled on Windows, by now issuing a proper error message instead of
      stumbling across the missing os.getuid() function.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Improved Windows portability by no longer attempting to import 'pwd' in
      case the userid is not set in the environment variables that are checked
      when the WBEM server is local.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for ExecQuery operation to twisted client.  (Robert Booth)

    * Added get() methods on CIMInstance and CIMInstanceName to step up to the
      statement that they behave like dictionaries w.r.t. properties and key
      bindings.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Improved help text of test_cim_operations.py test program.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Added an optional Params argument to InvokeMethod(), that is an ordered
      list of CIM input parameters, that preserves its order in the CIM-XML
      request message. This is to accomodate deficient WBEM servers that do
      not tolerate arbitrary order of method input parameters as required by
      the standard. The new argument is optional, making this a backwards
      compatible change of InvokeMethod().  (Andreas Maier)

    * Cleaned up the public symbols of each module by making symbols private
      that are used only internally. Specifically, the following symbols have
      been made private: In cimxml_parse: _get_required_attribute,
      _get_attribute, _get_end_event, _is_start, _is_end. In cim_xml: _text
      (was: Text).  (Andreas Maier)

    * Cleaned up symbols imported by wildcard import by defining __all__ in
      each module with only the public symbols defined in that module (removing
      any symbols imported into the module), except for the following modules
      which define less than the complete set of public symbols in their
      __all__: mof_compiler, twisted_client, tupleparse, cimxml_parse,
      cim_http.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for using CDATA section based escaping in any requests sent
      to the WBEM server. The default is still XML entity reference based
      escaping, the CDATA based escaping can be turned on by setting the switch
      _CDATA_ESCAPING accordingly, which is a global variable in the cim_xml
      module.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Simplified the exceptions that can be raised by WBEMConnection methods,
      and improved the information in the exception messages. See description
      of WBEMConnection class for details.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for timeouts to WBEMConnection, via a new timeout argument,
      that defaults to no timeout.  (This finally increased the minimum version
      of Python to 2.6.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Improved installation process of PyWBEM, particularly related to
      M2Crypto.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for Python 3.  Issue #3 on GitHub.
      (Ross Peoples, Andreas Maier)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix syntax error in CIM DTDVERSION error path.  Allow KEYVALUE
      VALUETYPE attribute to be optional as specified in the DTD.
      (Andreas Linke)

    * Added parsing of InvokeMethod return value and output parameters for
      Twisted Python client.  (Tim Potter)

    * Fixed cim_provider2.py to properly support shutdown() and can_unload()
      (called from CMPI cleanup() functions).  Support was recently added
      to cmpi-bindings for this.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed XML parsing to accept SFCB-style embedded instance parameters.
      (Mihai Ibanescu)

    * Use getpass module instead of pwd to detect local user to fix Win32.
      (Tim Potter)

    * Re-throw KeyError exceptions with capitalised key string instead
      of lower cased version in NocaseDict.__getitem__().  (Tim Potter)

    * Use base64.b64encode() instead of base64.encodestring() in Twisted
      client. (Mihai Ibanescu)

    * Fix missing CIMDateTime import in Twisted client.  (Mihai Ibanescu)

    * Fixed CIMInstanceName rendering to string. It is now possible to pass the
      rendered string value as an instance path argument of a CIM method.
      (Jan Safranek, Michal Minar)

    * For Python providers, fixed the comparsion of the Role parameter in
      association operations to be case insensitive, and removed an erroneous
      test that raised an exception when the property specified in the Role
      parameter was not also in the property list specified by the Properties
      parameter.  (Jan Safranek)

    * For Python providers, converted debug 'print' statements to trace
      messages that end up in the system log.  (Jan Safranek)

    * The CIM-XML parser no longer throws an exception when parsing a
      qualifier declaration.
      Note: The CIM-XML supported by this fix does not conform to DSP0201 so
      far. Further fixes are pending.  (Jan Safranek)

    * Fixed parsing errors for connection URLs with IPv6 addresses, including
      zone indexes (aka scope IDs).  (Peter Hatina, Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed the hard coded socket addressing family used for HTTPS that was
      incorrect in some IPv6 cases, by determining it dynamically.
      (Peter Hatina)

    * Fixed the list of output parameters of extrinsic method calls to be
      returned as a case insensitive dictionary (using cim_obj.NocaseDict).
      (Jan Safranek)

    * Fixed the checking of CIMVERSION attributes in CIM-XML to only verify the
      major version, consistent with DSP0201 (see subclause 5.2.1, in DSP0201
      version 2.3.1).  (Jan Safranek)

    * Fixed error in cim_http.py related to stronger type checking of Python
      2.7. (Eduardo de Barros Lima)

    * Removed erroneous qualifier scopes SCHEMA and QUALIFIER from the MOF
      compiler (see DSP0004).  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed debug logging of CIM-XML payload (that is, conn.last_*request/reply
      attributes) for extrinsic method calls, to now be consistent with
      intrinsic method calls.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) error when validating peer's
      certificate.  (Michal Minar)

    * Added a check in the CIMInstanceName constructor that the 'classname'
      argument is not None.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a tuple
      for the 'value' argument was incorrectly detected to be a scalar (and not
      an array).  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a
      datetime or timedelta typed value resulted in storing the provided object
      in the 'value' attribute, instead of converting it to a CIMDateTime
      object.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a datetime
      formatted string typed 'value' argument along with type='datetime'
      resulted in storing the provided string object in the 'value' attribute,
      instead of converting it to a CIMDateTime object.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed several cases in the CIMProperty constructor of unnecessarily
      requiring the optional arguments 'type', 'is_array', 'embedded_object',
      or 'reference_class'. These optional arguments are now only necessary to
      be provided if they cannot be implied from provided arguments (mainly
      from 'value').  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that an 'embedded_object'
      argument value of 'object' was changed to 'instance' when a CIMInstance
      typed 'value' argument was also provided.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that the first array
      element was used for defaulting the 'type' attribute, without checking
      that for None, causing an exception to be raised in this case.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Added a check in the CIMProperty constructor that the 'name' argument is
      not None.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed the issue that the CIMProperty constructor raised only TypeError
      even when the issue was not about types; it now raises in addition
      ValueError.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Changed the exception that is raised in NocaseDict.__setitem__() for
      invalid key types, to be TypeError in instead of KeyError. Updated the
      testcases accordingly.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added checks for more than one argument and for unsupported argument
      types to the constructor of NocaseDict.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed incorrectly labeled namespace variables in twisted client.
      (Robert Booth)

    * Fixed that WBEMConnection.last_raw_reply was not set to the current reply
      in case of parsing errors in the reply.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Reintroduced Python 2.6 support in cim_http.HTTPSConnection.connect()
      that disappeared in early drafts of this version:
      - Removed SSLTimeoutError from except list; being a subclass of SSLError,
        it is catched via SSLError.
      - Invoked socket.create_connection() without source_address, if running
        on Python 2.6.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed bug where HTTP body was attempted ot be read when CIMError header
      is set, causing a hang.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added CIM-XML declaration support for alternative PyWBEM client based
      on twisted.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for Windows to wbemcli.py, by making dependency on HOME
      environment variable optional, and adding HOMEPATH environment variable.
      Also, cleaned up the global namespace of wbemcli.py and made it
      importable as a module.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed errors in generated MOF (e.g. in any tomof() methods):
      - Missing backslash escaping within string literals for \n, \r, \t, \".
      - Representation of REF types was incorrect.
      - '=' in array-typed qualifier declarations was missing.
      - Fixed size indicator was missing in array elements.
      - Qualifiers of method parameters were missing.
      Improvements in generated MOF:
      - Changed order of qualifiers to be sorted by qualifier name.
      - Added empty line before each property and method in the class for
        better readability.
      - Method parameters are now placed on separate lines.
      - Moved generation of method qualifiers from class into method. This
        changes the behavior of CIMMethod.tomof() to now generate the method
        qualifiers.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed error where invoking mof_compiler.py with a file based URL that
      did not start with 'file:' failed with an undefined variable url_ in
      cim_http.py. Issue #1 on GitHub.  (Klaus Kaempf, Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed build error that raised a YaccError in mof_compiler.py:
      "Syntax error. Expected ':'". Issue #2 on GitHub.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed issue where MOF compiler did not find include files with
      a path specified. Issue #4 on GitHub.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

    * Added missing LocalOnly parameter to EnumerateInstances() of
      the wbemcli script. Issue #33 on GitHub.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

    * Added workaround for Python 2.6 for Python issue 15881.

    * Removed the lex.py and yacc.py files from PyWBEM, and used them from the
      `ply` package, which is their real home. This fixes a number of issues
      because the latest version is now used. Issue #8 on GitHub.i
      (Karl Schopmeyer)

    * Fixed the issue that the LEX and YACC table modules were regenerated
      under certain conditions.  Issue #55 on GitHub.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

    * Fixed bugs in the mof_compiler script.  (Karl Schopmeyer)

    * Fixed errors in the description of the qualifier operations in
      WBEMConnection.  Issue #91 on GitHub.  (Andreas Maier)

  TESTING:

    * Added support for running the unit test cases without having to be in the
      testsuite directory. This was done by setting up the DTD_FILE path
      correctly for any XML tests.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Improved the quality of assertion messages issued when testcases fail, to
      include context information and types.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added docstrings to test cases.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added testcases for CIMProperty.__init__() to be comprehensive.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * In XML validation tests, added the expected XML root element.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Added a header to any error messages issued by xmllint.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fix: Merged stderr into stdout for the xmllint invocation, xmllint error
      messages go to stderr and had been dropped before.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fix: The "mkdir -p ..:" command in the comfychair testcase constructor
      created subdirectories named "-p" when running on Windows; replaced that
      command with os.makedirs().  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fix: Replaced the "rm -fr ..." command in the comfychair testcase
      constructor with shutil.rmtree(), in order to better run on Windows.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Fix: In comfychair._enter_rundir(), moved registration of cleanup
      function _restore_directory() to the end, so cleanup happens only if no
      errors happened.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed a bug in pywbem/trunk/testsuite/test_tupleparse.py in function
      ParseCIMProperty.runtest(), where the use of real tab characters caused
      a few lines to be incorrectly indented, and as a result, ignored for the
      test.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Improved Windows portability in testsuite: Moved from using the Unix-only
      functions posix.WIFSIGNALED() and posix.WEXITSTATUS() for testing the
      success of subprocess.wait(), to simply testing for 0.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added ability to invoke test_cim_operations.py with comfychair arguments,
      and added printing of exception information if an operation fails.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Migrated from comfychair to py.test, standard Python unittest, and to
      tox.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added test_client.py with a few initial testcases. This is an end-to-end
      test concept that allows specifying test cases that cover the entire
      PyWBEM Client top to bottom. It mocks the socket layer and allows
      specifying the test cases in YAML, starting with input at the PyWBEM
      Client API (e.g. an operation and its parameters), the expected CIM-XML
      request at the socket payload level resulting from this input (the
      request is verified), the CIM-XML response that is to be generated,
      and finally an expected result at the PyWBEM Client API that is being
      verified.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added use of Travis CI test environment. Commits to GitHub now trigger
      test runs on the Travis CI. A badge on the GitHub README page shows
      the current test result of the master branch, and links to the Travis
      site for the test results of the branches of any pull requests.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for reporting test coverage, using the Python 'coverage'
      package. Coverage is reported on stdout as part of testing, e.g. with
      'make test' for the current Python environment, or with 'tox' for all
      supported Python environments.  (Andreas Maier)

  CLEAN CODE:

    * Removed dangerous default parameter '{}' from CIMProperty and
      CIMInstanceName, and replaced it with 'None'. To support that, added
      support for initializing an empty NocaseDict object from 'None'.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * In cim_obj, changed the use of the deprecated backticks to using %r in
      the format string (which produces the same result).  (Andreas Maier)

    * In the constructor of CIMInstanceName, added assertions to some paths
      that cannot possibly be taken based on the fact that the keybindings
      attribute is always a NocaseDict. They should be removed at some point.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Addressed PyLint issues:
      - Consolidated imports at the top of the module (after module docstring),
        consistent with the PEP-8 recommendation.
      - Ensured order of imports: standard, non-standard, pywbem, local (on a
        subset of modules only).
      - Replaced wildcard imports with specific imports, as much as possible.
      - Removed unused imports.
      - Addressed PyLint issues that are related to whitespace, continuation
        indentation, and line length.
      - Replaced all real tab characters with spaces.
      - Many more PyLint issues
      (Andreas Maier, Karl Schopmeyer)

  PACKAGING / BUILD:

    * Fixed grammatical funkiness in the license text.  No change to actual
      license - still LGPLv2.  (Tim Potter)

    * Added LICENSE.txt file to release.  (Tim Potter)

    * Added LICENSE.txt, NEWS, README and INSTALL files to distribution
      archive.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Fixed inconsistencies in license text in file headers to consistently
      say LGPL 2.1 or higher (The LICENSE.txt file has always been LGPL 2.1).
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Removed confusing section about build from INSTALL file, to scope it just
      to the topic of installation.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Restructured pywbem/trunk subtree to move pywbem package files into a
      pywbem subdirectory.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added a makefile (invoke 'make help' for valid targets).  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for checking the Python source code using PyLint.
      (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for generating HTML documentation using epydoc, and
      included the documentation into the distribution archive. The syntax
      used in Python docstrings is reStructuredText markdown.   (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for installing OS-level prerequisites via the new setup.py
      script commands 'install_os' and 'develop_os'.  (Andreas Maier)

    * Added support for installing Python-level prerequisites when installing
      in development mode using the setup.py script command 'develop'.
      (Andreas Maier)


pywbem-0.7  2008-12-12

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fixed enumInstances and references in cim_provider to do a deep
      copy of the model before filtering instances so provider writers
      are less surprised.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added CIMDateTime.__cmp__() so that CIMDateTime instances can be
      compared.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed data types of method return values for python providers.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed REF array out parameters in tupleparse.py.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed Array parameters with no elements.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed precision for real32 and real64 types.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed Array properties where is_array isn't set in __init__.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added NocaseDict.__cmp__(self, other).  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed WBEMConnection.__repr__ for anonymous connections. (Tim Potter)

    * Fixed XML encoding of CIMQualifierDeclarations.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed EnumerateQualifiers if there are no qualifiers.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fixed InvokeMethod to only send a LOCALCLASSPATH or LOCALINSTANCEPATH,
      not a CLASSPATH or INSTANCEPATH.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fix unexpected line break in basic auth header for long
      credentials.  (Daniel Hiltgen)

    * Fix Host: HTTP header when connecting to a unix domain socket.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fix deprecation warnings with Python 2.6.  (Bart Whiteley)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Added support for generating Pegasus provider registration MOF in
      cim_provider.codegen(). (Bart Whiteley)

    * Implemented methods to parse indication export requests.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Python provider code generation enhancements.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Support for Pegasus Local authentication.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Support for Pegasus and OpenWBEM Unix Domain Socket.  (Tim and Bart)

    * Added support for Pegasus non-compliant EMBEDDEDOBJECT XML attribute.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added CIMQualifierDeclaration.tomof().  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added a powerful MOF compiler.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added property filtering to CIMInstance.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added value attribute to CIMParameter.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Rigged CIMInstance to automagically update CIMInstance.path.keybindings
      as key properties are set.  (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added cim_provider2.py: A new provider interface.  Python providers
      using this interface can use the cmpi-bindings project within OMC
      (http://omc-project.org/) to run under any CIMOM supporting the
      CMPI interface.  This is prefered to the old cim_provider.py interface
      that was used with the Python Provider Managers for OpenWBEM and Pegasus.

    * Changed __init__.py to not import anything from cim_provider.py (or
      cim_provider2.py) into the pywbem namespace.  Existing providers based
      on cim_provider.py can still work with a minor adjustment involving
      importing CIMProvider from pywbem.cim_provider.  The codegen funtion
      can now be obtained with 'from pywbem.cim_provider import codegen', or
      'from pywbem.cim_provider2 import codegen' or similar.

    * Added wbemcli.py command line utility.  (Tim Potter)

    * Pass keyword args in unix domain socket connection functions down to
      WBEMConnection().  (Tim Potter)


pywbem-0.6  2007-10-26

  LICENSING:

    * Relicensed from the GNU GPLv2 to the GNU LGPLv2.

  API CHANGES:

    * Add a type keyword arg and attribute to CIMQualifier, similar to
      the CIMProperty object, to allow the creation of null qualifiers.
      (Tim Potter)

    * Remove the toxml() method from CIM object classes.  Use
      tocimxml().toxml() instead which specifies the CIM-XML
      representation of the object. (Tim Potter)

    * CIMDateTime class should now be used instead of datetime.datetime
      and datetime.timedelta.

    * Added a new method, CIMInstance.update_existing().  This behaves
      like update() on a dict, but only assigns new values to existing
      properties.  It skips values for properties not already present
      in the instance.  This is useful for honoring PropertyList within
      python providers.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Explicitly specify charset="utf-8" in HTTP Content-type header
      as this is required now by the Pegasus cimserver.  (Tim Potter)

    * Parse VALUETYPE elements that contain a TYPE attribute.  This
      feature was introduced in version 2.2 of the CIM-XML DTD and
      produced by some CIMOMs such as the Java WBEM Server.  (Tim Potter)

    * Don't require CreateInstance to have the path attribute set but
      if it is, use the namespace from it.  (Tim Potter)

    * Allow extrinsic methods to return object references.  (Tim Potter)

    * Fix CIMInstanceName to support more numeric types of keybindings.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fix datetime values to support utc offset. (Bart Whiteley)

    * Fix http client to monitor the connection more closely (RFC 2616
      section 8.2.2).  Previously, a large request could cause a socket
      exception with no ability to read the response and respond to
      an authentication challenge.

    * Fix NULL qualifiers to have a (required) type. (Martin Mrazik)

    * Fix initialising CIMInstanceName keys from a NocaseDict. (Bart
      Whiteley)

    * Return correct namespace in path for return value from
      GetInstance. (Tim Potter)

    * Numerous bugfixes to Twisted Python client. (Tim Potter)

    * Fix for x.509 SSL certificate handling. (Bas ten Berge)

    * EnumerateClassNames() now returns an empty list instead of None
      if there are no classes. (Bart Whiteley)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Support for OpenWBEM password-less local authentication.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Support for embedded objects is described in DSP0201-2.2.0
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * New CIMDateTime class to deal with CIM-isms of datetimes.
      Most notably, datetime deals with timezone info poorly.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Add InvokeMethod() support in Twisted Python client. (Tim
      Potter)

pywbem-0.5  2006-11-21

  API CHANGES:

    * Many API changes were made to simplify the function and object
      interface of PyWBEM.  Aspects of just about every CIM operation
      call and CIM object have changed.  The major changes are:

      - The "LocalNamespacePath" keyword argument has been renamed to
        simply "namespace" for all CIM operations.

      - Replaced all object location classes with CIMInstanceName, and
        all instance classes with CIMInstance.  CIMInstanceName now
        has "host" and "namespace" attributes to fully name a
        reference to an instance.  The CIMInstance class now has a
        "path" attribute which is of type CIMInstanceName.

      - EnumerateInstances() now returns a list of CIMInstance objects
        (with path attribute set) instead of a list of
        CIMNamedInstance or tuples of (CIMInstanceName, CIMInstance).

      - All representations of properties can now be represented with
        the CIMProperty class.

    * All classes now have a copy() method which return a deep copy of
      the object.  PyWBEM makes extensive use of dictionary objects
      which are passed by reference in Python.  Use the copy() method
      to create and manipulate objects without modifying them by
      accident.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix parse bug when a CIMInstanceName is passed as the
      localobject parameter to WBEMConnection.InvokeMethod().

    * Fix parsing of INSTANCE elements containing PROPERTY.REFERENCE
      elements bug found by Bart Whiteley.  This turns up when
      processing associations. (Tim Potter)

    * Handle extrinsic method calls that don't return a value or any
      output parameters. (Tim Potter)

    * Fixed parsing of PARAMETER.ARRAY and PARAMETER.REFARRAY to
      not require optional attrs. (Bart Whiteley)

    * Atomic_to_cim_xml string generation for a datetime - was missing
      a >> '.' in the string. (Norm Paxton)

    * InvokeMethod did not provide for 'None' in output parameters.
      (Norm Paxton)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * More parts of the class provider interface have been
      implemented.  (Tim Potter, Bart Whiteley)

    * Many case-sensitivity bugs, mostly in __cmp__ methods, were
      found and fixed.  (Tim Potter)

    * Implemented a test suite for maintaining backward compatibility
      and testing new features.  (Tim Potter)

    * Implemented ExecQuery. (Bart Whiteley)

    * Allow a string classname to be passed as the localobject
      parameter to WBEMConnection.InvokeMethod(). (Tim Potter)

    * Add missing qualifiers on array properties. (Bart Whiteley)

    * Added code for performing asynchronous WBEM client operations
      using the Twisted Python framework. (Tim Potter)

    * Allow extrinsic method calls that take parameters. (Tim Potter)

    * Added cim_http.AuthError exception class.  This is raised if the
      CIMOM returns a 401 (Unauthorized).  Now the client can
      distinguish this condition, and (re)prompt for credentials.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Created cim_obj.CIMParameter class.  Added return type,
      class origin, propagated to CIMMethod.  CIMParameter object
      now allows parameter types and qualifiers to be obtained.
      (Bart Whiteley)

    * Implemented case-insensitive keys for property and qualifier
      dictionaries, as per the CIM specification.  (Tim Potter, Bart
      Whitely)


pywbem-0.4  2005-11-15

  BUG FIXES:

    * Correctly calculate value of Content-Length HTTP header to include
      opening XML stanza. (Szalai Ferenc)

    * Fix syntax error when re-raising socket errors. (Pat Knight)

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Support for marshaling and unmarshaling CIM dates object into
      Python datetime objects. (Szalai Ferenc)

    * Experimental module for making asynchronous WBEM calls with
      PyWBEM in Twisted Python. (Tim Potter)

    * Add parameter type checking for object location classes. (Tim
      Potter)

    * Allow caller to pass in a dictionary containing the location of
      the SSL certificate and key files as per the httplib.HTTPSConnection()
      class constructor. (Pat Knight)

  API CHANGES:

    * Change association provider API functions to take a fixed
      parameter for the named object instead of a keyword argument.
      This breaks backward compatibility. (Tim Potter)

    * Remove the CIMLocalNamespacePath class and replaced by a Python
      string. (Tim Potter)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Don't use UserDict.DictMixin base class as it only exists in
      Python 2.3 and higher. (Tim Potter)

  TESTS:

    * Add tests for parameter type checking for object location
      classes. (Tim Potter)

    * Add tests for string representation of object location classes.
      (Tim Potter)
