"""
tupletree - Convert XML DOM objects to and from tuple trees.

DOM is the standard in-memory representation of XML documents, but it
is very cumbersome for some types of processing where XML encodes
object structures rather than text documents.  Direct mapping to Python
classes may not be a good match either.

tupletrees may be created from an in-memory DOM using
dom_to_tupletree(), or from a string using xml_to_tupletree().

Since the Python XML libraries deal mostly with Unicode strings they
are also returned here.  If plain Strings are passed in they will be
converted by xmldom.

Each node of the tuple tree is a Python 4-tuple, corresponding to an
XML Element (i.e. <tag>):

  (NAME, ATTRS, CONTENTS, None)

The NAME is the name of the element.

The ATTRS are a name-value dictionary of element attributes, not preserving
order.

The CONTENTS is a list of child elements, preserving order.

The fourth element is reserved.

    having catched an `ExpatError` from `xml.dom.minidom` or a

    Parameters:

      utf8_string (:term:`byte string`):
        The UTF-8 encoded XML string to be examined.

      meaning (:term:`string`):
        Short text with meaning of the XML string, for messages in exceptions.

      conn_id (:term:`connection id`): Connection ID to be used in any

    Returns:

      :term:`unicode string`: The input string, converted to Unicode.

    Raises:

      TypeError: Invoked with incorrect Python object type for `utf8_xml`.

      pywbem.XMLParseError: `utf8_xml` contains invalid UTF-8 sequences.

    Notes on Unicode support in Python:

    (1) For internally representing Unicode characters in the unicode type, a
        "wide" Unicode build of Python uses UTF-32, while a "narrow" Unicode
        build uses UTF-16. The difference is visible to Python programs for
        Unicode characters assigned to code points above U+FFFF: The "narrow"
        build uses 2 characters (a surrogate pair) for them, while the "wide"
        build uses just 1 character. This affects all position- and
        length-oriented functions, such as `len()` or string slicing.

    (2) In a "wide" Unicode build of Python, the Unicode characters assigned to
        code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF are represented directly (using code
        points U+10000 to U+10FFFF) and the surrogate code points
        U+D800...U+DFFF are never used; in a "narrow" Unicode build of Python,
        the Unicode characters assigned to code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF are
        represented using pairs of the surrogate code points U+D800...U+DFFF.

    Notes on the Unicode code points U+D800...U+DFFF ("surrogate code points"):

    (1) These code points have no corresponding Unicode characters assigned,
        because they are reserved for surrogates in the UTF-16 encoding.

    (2) The UTF-8 encoding can technically represent the surrogate code points.
        ISO/IEC 10646 defines that a UTF-8 sequence containing the surrogate
        code points is ill-formed, but it is technically possible that such a
        sequence is in a UTF-8 encoded XML string.

    (3) The Python escapes ``\\u`` and ``\\U`` used in literal strings can
        represent the surrogate code points (as well as all other code points,
        regardless of whether they are assigned to Unicode characters).

    (4) The Python `encode()` and `decode()` functions successfully
        translate the surrogate code points back and forth for encoding UTF-8.

        For example, ``b'\\xed\\xb0\\x80'.decode("utf-8") = u'\\udc00'``.

    (5) Because Python supports the encoding and decoding of UTF-8 sequences
        also for the surrogate code points, the "narrow" Unicode build of
        Python can be (mis-)used to transport each surrogate unit separately
        encoded in (ill-formed) UTF-8.

        For example, code point U+10122 can be (illegally) created from a
        sequence of code points U+D800,U+DD22 represented in UTF-8:

          ``b'\\xED\\xA0\\x80\\xED\\xB4\\xA2'.decode("utf-8") = u'\\U00010122'``

        while the correct UTF-8 sequence for this code point is:

          ``u'\\U00010122'.encode("utf-8") = b'\\xf0\\x90\\x84\\xa2'``
