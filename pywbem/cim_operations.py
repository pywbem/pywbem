    `pywbem.ParseError` providing more useful information.

      characters.

    Notes on Unicode support in Python:

    (1) For internally representing Unicode characters in the unicode type, a
        "wide" Unicode build of Python uses UTF-32, while a "narrow" Unicode
        build uses UTF-16. The difference is visible to Python programs for
        Unicode characters assigned to code points above U+FFFF: The "narrow"
        build uses 2 characters (a surrogate pair) for them, while the "wide"
        build uses just 1 character. This affects all position- and
        length-oriented functions, such as `len()` or string slicing.

    (2) In a "wide" Unicode build of Python, the Unicode characters assigned to
        code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF are represented directly (using code
        points U+10000 to U+10FFFF) and the surrogate code points
        U+D800...U+DFFF are never used; in a "narrow" Unicode build of Python,
        the Unicode characters assigned to code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF are
        represented using pairs of the surrogate code points U+D800...U+DFFF.

    Notes on the Unicode code points U+D800...U+DFFF ("surrogate code points"):

    (1) These code points have no corresponding Unicode characters assigned,
        because they are reserved for surrogates in the UTF-16 encoding.

    (2) The UTF-8 encoding can technically represent the surrogate code points.
        ISO/IEC 10646 defines that a UTF-8 sequence containing the surrogate
        code points is ill-formed, but it is technically possible that such a
        sequence is in a UTF-8 encoded XML string.

    (3) The Python escapes ``\\u`` and ``\\U`` used in literal strings can
        represent the surrogate code points (as well as all other code points,
        regardless of whether they are assigned to Unicode characters).

    (4) The Python `encode()` and `decode()` functions successfully
        translate the surrogate code points back and forth for encoding UTF-8.

        For example, ``b'\\xed\\xb0\\x80'.decode("utf-8") = u'\\udc00'``.

    (5) Because Python supports the encoding and decoding of UTF-8 sequences
        also for the surrogate code points, the "narrow" Unicode build of
        Python can be (mis-)used to transport each surrogate unit separately
        encoded in (ill-formed) UTF-8.

        For example, code point U+10122 can be (illegally) created from a
        sequence of code points U+D800,U+DD22 represented in UTF-8:

          ``b'\\xED\\xA0\\x80\\xED\\xB4\\xA2'.decode("utf-8") = u'\\U00010122'``

        while the correct UTF-8 sequence for this code point is:

          ``u'\\U00010122'.encode("utf-8") = b'\\xf0\\x90\\x84\\xa2'``

    Notes on XML characters:

class WBEMConnection(object):  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    """
    A client's connection to a WBEM server. This is the main class of the
    WBEM client library API.

    The connection object knows a default CIM namespace, which is used when no
    namespace is specified on subsequent WBEM operations (that support
    specifying namespaces). Thus, the connection object can be used as a
    connection to multiple CIM namespaces on a WBEM server (when the namespace
    is specified on subsequent operations), or as a connection to only the
    default namespace (this allows omitting the namespace on subsequent
    operations).

    As usual in HTTP, there is no persistent TCP connection; the connectedness
    provided by this class is  only conceptual. That is, the creation of the
    connection object does not cause any interaction with the WBEM server, and
    each subsequent WBEM operation performs an independent, state-less
    HTTP/HTTPS request.

    After creating a :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object, various methods
    may be called on the object, which cause WBEM operations to be issued to
    the WBEM server. See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of these methods.

    CIM elements such as instances or classes are represented as Python objects
    (see :ref:`CIM objects`). The caller does not need to know about the CIM-XML
    encoding of CIM elements and protocol payload that is used underneath (It
    should be possible to use a different WBEM protocol below this layer without
    disturbing any callers).

    The connection remembers the XML of the last request and last reply if
    debugging is turned on via the :attr:`debug` attribute of the
    connection object.
    This may be useful in debugging: If a problem occurs, you can examine the
    :attr:`last_request` and :attr:`last_reply` attributes of the
    connection object.
    These are the prettified XML of request and response, respectively.
    The real request and response that are sent and received are available in
    the :attr:`last_raw_request` and :attr:`last_raw_reply` attributes
    of the connection object.

    The methods of this class may raise the following exceptions:

    * Exceptions indicating processing errors:

      - :exc:`~pywbem.ConnectionError` - A connection with the WBEM server
        could not be established or broke down.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.AuthError` - Authentication failed with the WBEM server.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.HTTPError` - HTTP error (bad status code) received from
        WBEM server.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.ParseError` - The response from the WBEM server cannot
        be parsed (for example, invalid characters or UTF-8 sequences,
        ill-formed XML, or invalid CIM-XML).

      - :exc:`~pywbem.CIMError` - The WBEM server returned an error response
        with a CIM status code.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.TimeoutError` - The WBEM server did not respond in time
        and the client timed out.

    * Exceptions indicating programming errors:

      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.TypeError`
      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.KeyError`
      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError`
      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.AttributeError`
      - ... possibly others ...

      Exceptions indicating programming errors should not happen. If you think
      the reason such an exception is raised lies in pywbem,
      `report a bug <https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/issues>`_.

    Attributes:

      ... : All parameters of the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` constructor
        are set as public attribute with the same name.

      ... : There are some additional properties documented for this class,
        further down.

      debug (:class:`py:bool`): A boolean indicating whether logging of
        the last request and last reply is enabled.

        The initial value of this attribute is `False`.
        Debug logging can be enabled for future operations by setting this
        attribute to `True`.

      last_request (:term:`unicode string`):
        CIM-XML data of the last request sent to the WBEM server
        on this connection, formatted as prettified XML. Prior to sending the
        very first request on this connection object, it is `None`.

      last_raw_request (:term:`unicode string`):
        CIM-XML data of the last request sent to the WBEM server
        on this connection, formatted as it was sent. Prior to sending the
        very first request on this connection object, it is `None`.

      last_reply (:term:`unicode string`):
        CIM-XML data of the last response received from the WBEM server
        on this connection, formatted as prettified XML. Prior to receiving
        the very first response on this connection object, it is `None`.

      last_raw_reply (:term:`unicode string`):
        CIM-XML data of the last response received from the WBEM server
        on this connection, formatted as it was received. Prior to receiving
        the very first response on this connection object, it is `None`.

      last_request_len (:class:`py:int`):
        The size of the HTTP body in the CIM-XML request of the last operation,
        in Bytes. Prior to sending the very first request on this connection
        object, or if the last operation raised an exception, it is 0.

      last_reply_len (:class:`py:int`):
        The size of the HTTP body in the CIM-XML response of the last
        operation, in Bytes. Prior to receiving the very first response on this
        connection object, or if the last operation raised an exception, it
        is 0.

      operation_recorder (:class:`~pywbem.BaseOperationRecorder`):
        This attribute provides for recording of the operations that are
        executed on this connection. Initially, this attribute is `None`.
        If `None`, no operations are recorded.
        If set to an object of a subclass of
        :class:`~pywbem.BaseOperationRecorder`, each operation
        that is executed on this connection will be recorded by
        invoking its :meth:`~pywbem.BaseOperationRecorder.record` method.

        All operations except the Iter... operations may be recorded. Since
        the Iter... operations utilize the other operations to send requests
        their calls are NOT recorded.

      use_pull_operations (:class:`py:bool`):
        Indicates whether the client will attempt the use of pull operations in
        any `Iter...()` methods. However, each operation has its own internal
        equivalent flag based on this flag to allow for implementations that
        implement only some of the pull operations. The method
        `set_use_pull_operations` may be used to reset all of these flags to
        a defined value.

        This variable is initially set from the same-named input argument.
        If it is initially `None`, it is modified when `Iter...()` methods are
        invoked, dependent on the support for pull operations in the WBEM
        server.
        After the first call , the variable will be either `True` or `False`
        and indicating whether pull operations will be used in this and
        subsequent `Iter...()` methods.

        Parameters:

          url (:term:`string`):
            URL of the WBEM server, in the format:

              ``[{scheme}://]{host}[:{port}]``

            The following URL schemes are supported:

            * ``https``: Causes HTTPS to be used.
            * ``http``: Causes HTTP to be used.

            The host can be specified in any of the usual formats:

            * a short or fully qualified DNS hostname
            * a literal (= dotted) IPv4 address
            * a literal IPv6 address, formatted as defined in :term:`RFC3986`
              with the extensions for zone identifiers as defined in
              :term:`RFC6874`, supporting ``-`` (minus) for the delimiter
              before the zone ID string, as an additional choice to ``%25``.

            If no port is specified in the URL, the default ports are:

            * If HTTPS is used, port 5989.
            * If HTTP is used, port 5988.

            Examples for some URL formats:

            * ``"https://10.11.12.13:6988"``:
              Use HTTPS to port 6988 on host 10.11.12.13
            * ``"https://mysystem.acme.org"``:
              Use HTTPS to port 5989 on host mysystem.acme.org
            * ``"10.11.12.13"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 on host 10.11.12.13
            * ``"http://[2001:db8::1234]:15988"``:
              Use HTTP to port 15988 on host 2001:db8::1234
            * ``"http://[::ffff.10.11.12.13]"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 on host ::ffff.10.11.12.13 (an
              IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
            * ``"http://[2001:db8::1234%25eth0]"`` or
              ``"http://[2001:db8::1234-eth0]"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 to host 2001:db8::1234 (a link-local IPv6
              address) using zone identifier eth0

          creds (:class:`py:tuple` of userid, password):
            Credentials for HTTP authenticatiion with the WBEM server, as a
            tuple(userid, password), with:

            * userid (:term:`string`):
              Userid for authenticating with the WBEM server.

            * password (:term:`string`):
              Password for that userid.

            If `None`, the client will not generate ``Authorization`` headers
            in the HTTP request. Otherwise, the client will generate an
            ``Authorization`` header using HTTP Basic Authentication.

            See :ref:`Authentication types` for an overview.

          default_namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used by default (if no namespace
            is specified for an operation).

            Default: :data:`~pywbem.cim_constants.DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`.

          x509 (:class:`py:dict`):
            :term:`X.509` client certificate and key file to be presented
            to the WBEM server during the TLS/SSL handshake.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            If `None`, no client certificate is presented to the server,
            resulting in 1-way authentication to be used.

            Otherwise, the client certificate is presented to the server,
            resulting in 2-way authentication to be used.
            This parameter must be a dictionary containing the following
            two items:

              * ``"cert_file"`` (:term:`string`):
                The file path of a file containing an :term:`X.509` client
                certificate.

              * ``"key_file"`` (:term:`string`):
                The file path of a file containing the private key belonging to
                the public key that is part of the :term:`X.509` certificate
                file.

            See :ref:`Authentication types` for an overview.

          verify_callback (:term:`callable`):
            Registers a callback function that will be called to verify the
            X.509 server certificate returned by the WBEM server during the
            TLS/SSL handshake, in addition to the validation already performed
            by the TLS/SSL support.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            Note that the validation performed by the TLS/SSL support already
            includes the usual validation, so that normally a callback function
            does not need to be used. See :ref:`Verification of the X.509 server
            certificate` for details.

            Warning: This parameter is not used when the python environment
            is Python 3 because the ssl module does not support it.

            If `None`, no such callback function will be registered.

            The specified function will be called for the returned certificate,
            and for each of the certificates in its chain of trust.

            See `M2Crypto.SSL.Context.set_verify` for details, as well as
            http://blog.san-ss.com.ar/2012/05/validating-ssl-certificate-in-python.html):

            The callback function must take five parameters:

            * the `M2Crypto.SSL.Connection` object that triggered the
              verification.

            * an `OpenSSL.crypto.X509` object representing the certificate
              to be validated (the returned certificate or one of the
              certificates in its chain of trust).

            * an integer containing the error number (0 in case no error) of
              any validation error detected by `M2Crypto`.
              You can find their meaning in the OpenSSL documentation.

            * an integer indicating the depth (=position) of the certificate to
              be validated (the one in the second parameter) in the chain of
              trust of the returned certificate. A value of 0 indicates
              that the returned certificate is currently validated; any other
              value indicates the distance of the currently validated
              certificate to the returned certificate in its chain of trust.

            * an integer that indicates whether the validation of the
              certificate specified in the second parameter passed or did not
              pass the validation by `M2Crypto`. A value of 1 indicates a
              successful validation and 0 an unsuccessful one.

            The callback function must return `True` if the verification
            passes and `False` otherwise.

          ca_certs (:term:`string`):
            Location of CA certificates (trusted certificates) for
            verifying the X.509 server certificate returned by the WBEM server.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            The parameter value is either the directory path of a directory
            prepared using the ``c_rehash`` tool included with OpenSSL, or the
            file path of a file in PEM format.

            If `None`, default directory paths will be used to look up CA
            certificates (see :data:`~pywbem.cim_http.DEFAULT_CA_CERT_PATHS`).

          no_verification (:class:`py:bool`):
            Disables verification of the X.509 server certificate returned by
            the WBEM server during TLS/SSL handshake, disables verification of
            the hostname, and disables the invocation of a verification function
            specified in `verify_callback`.

            If `True`, verification is disabled; otherwise, verification is
            enabled.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            Disabling the verification of the server certificate is insecure
            and should be avoided!

          timeout (:term:`number`):
            Timeout in seconds, for requests sent to the server. If the server
            did not respond within the timeout duration, the socket for the
            connection will be closed, causing a :exc:`~pywbem.TimeoutError` to
            be raised.

            A value of `None` means that the connection uses the standard
            timeout behavior of Python sockets, which can be between several
            minutes and much longer. Because this is somewhat unpredictable,
            it is recommended to specify a value for the timeout.

            A value of ``0`` means the timeout is very short, and does not
            really make any sense.

            Note that not all situations can be handled within this timeout, so
            for some issues, operations may take longer before raising an
            exception.

          use_pull_operations (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the use of pull operations in any `Iter...()` methods, by
            intializing a corresponding instance variable that is used during
            any `Iter...()` methods.
            The default value (`None`) will work on any WBEM server whether or
            not it supports pull operations.

            `None` means that the `Iter...()` methods will attempt a pull
            operation first, and if the WBEM server does not support it, will
            use a traditional operation. The corresponding instance variable
            will be adjusted to indicate what the WBEM server supports.

            `True` means that the `Iter...()` methods will only use pull
            operations. If the WBEM server does not support pull operations, a
            :exc:`~pywbem.CIMError` with status code `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`
            will be raised.

            `False` means that the `Iter...()` methods will only use traditional
            operations.

          enable_stats (:class:`py:bool`):
            Initial enablement status for maintaining statistics about the
            WBEM operations executed via this connection. See the
            :ref:`Statistics` section for details.

            Statistics may also be enabled or disabled with the WBEMConnection
            property `stats_enabled`. This may be used to view the current
            status or change the status (ex. `conn.stats_enabled(False)`)

            **Experimental:** This argument is experimental for this release.

          enable_log (:class:`py_bool` or :class:`py_integer`):
            Defines whether logging of operations and http requests should
            be executed.   If this is a bool True, logging of the complete
            operations calls and responses and the complete http requests are
            logged. If False, Nothing is logged.

            Logging destinations and further information about the loggers
            is defined through the _logger module

              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string` or :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a  string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A list of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` objects that are
            representations of the enumerated instances.

            The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
            object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
            attributes set as follows:

            * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
            * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
            * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
            * `host`: `None`, indicating the WBEM server is unspecified.

        A generator function to retrieve instances from a WBEM Server.
        This method frees the user of choices between the multiple
        EnumerateInstances/OpenEnumerateInstance methods and reduces
        the enumeration to a pythonic iterator idiom.

        **Experimental:** This method is experimental in this release.

        This method performs either the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`
        operations (pull operations) or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstances` operation
        (traditional operation) if the WBEM server does not support the
        pull operations. It is an alternative to using these operations
        directly, that automatically uses the pull operations if supported.

        The `use_pull_operations` argument of the
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` constructor can be used to
        override that default behavior to either force the use of pull
        operations or to avoid their use.

        NOTE: This functionality assumes that pull operations may not be
        supported for all of the pull operation types (i.e. operations whose
        name starts with Open). Even if one `Open...` function is not
        implemented (returns `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`) and that operation is
        used as the first request, the code will try the Open... on other pull
        operation types the first time each type is used.

        This method provides all of the controls of the pull operations API
        except the ability to set the response size on each request; response
        size (defined by `MaxObjectCount` is the same for all of the request
        operations in the sequence). There are, limitations in that:

          * The filter function does not exist for EnumerateInstances
            so that a request with `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
            attribute will be rejected if the pull operatons do not exist on
            the target WBEM Server.

          * If `ContinueOnError` is set and the pull operations are not
            supported on the server, the request is rejected.

        An open request may be closed while the iteration process is being
        executed by issuing the iterator close() method.

        If the initial request of the operation sequence succeeds, this method
        returns a Python iterator object so that the instances that are
        returned from the server can be retrieved with iterator expressions.

        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string` or :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a  string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'. If this
            attribute is `True` and the method uses the EnumerateInstances
            option (either `use_pull_operations` == `False` or the server does
            not support pull operations), the method will fail with a
            ValueError.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter. If this
            attribute is `True` and the method uses the EnumerateInstances
            option (either `use_pull_operations` == `False` or the server does
            not support pull operations), the method will fail with a
            ValueError

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

            Many WBEM servers do not support this request attribute so that
            its use is NOT recommended except in special cases.

            If this attribute is `True` and the method uses the
            EnumerateInstances option (`use_pull_operations` == `False`
            or the server does not support pull operations), the method will
            fail with a ValueError

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for each of the open and pull requests issues as part of the
            execution of this generator.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

            The choice of MaxObjectCount is client/server dependent but choices
            between 100 and 1000 typically do not have a significant impact on
            either memory or overall efficiency.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        Returns:

          A Python :term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object. Instances that are retrieved
          include the host and namespace component of the instance path.

        Example::

            insts_iterator = conn.IterEnumerateInstances('CIM_Blah')
            for inst in insts_iterator:
                # close if a particular property value found
                if inst.get('thisPropertyName') == 0

        A generator function to retrieve instance paths from a WBEM Server.
        This method frees the user of choices between the multiple
        EnumerateInstances/OpenEnumerateInstance methods and reduces
        the enumeration to a pythonic iterator idiom.

        **Experimental:** This method is experimental in this release.

        This method performs either the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstancePaths` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths`
        operations (pull operations) or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstanceNames` operation
        (traditional operation) if the WBEM server does not support the
        pull operations. It is an alternative to using these operations
        directly, that automatically uses the pull operations if supported.

        The `use_pull_operations` argument of the
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` constructor can be used to
        override that default behavior to either force the use of pull
        operations or to avoid their use.

        NOTE: This functionality assumes that pull operations are supported for
        either all or none of the defined `Open....`  Since the first request
        determines whether operations continue with the pull operations, if
        one of the `Open...` functions is not implemented
        (returns `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`) and that operation is used as the
        first request, the code will decide that None of the operations are
        supported. Resetting the use_pull_operations to `None` may be used to
        override the decision made by the `Iter...` method for other operations.

        This method provides all of the controls of the pull operations API
        except the ability to set the response size on each request; response
        size (defined by `MaxObjectCount` is the same for all of the request
        operations in the sequence). There are, limitations in that:

          * The filter function does not exist for EnumerateInstances
            so that a request with `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
            attribute will be rejected if the pull operatons do not exist on the
            target WBEM Server.

          * If `ContinueOnError` is set and the pull operations are not
            supported on the server, the request is rejected.

        An open request may be closed while the iteration process is being
        executed by issuing the iterator close() method.

        If the initial request of the operation sequence succeeds, this method
        returns a Python iterator object so that the instances that are returned
        from the server can be retrieved with iterator expressions.

        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'. If this
            attribute is `True` and the method uses the EnumerateInstances
            option (either `use_pull_operations` == `False` or the server does
            not support pull operations), the method will fail with a
            ValueError.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter. If this
            attribute is `True` and the method uses the EnumerateInstances
            option (either `use_pull_operations` == `False` or the server does
            not support pull operations), the method will fail with a
            ValueError

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

            Many WBEM servers do not support this request attribute so that
            its use is NOT recommended except in special cases.

            If this attribute is `True` and the method uses the
            EnumerateInstances option (`use_pull_operations` == `False`
            or the server does not support pull operations), the method will
            fail with a ValueError

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instance paths the WBEM server may return
            for each of the open and pull requests issues as part of the
            execution of this iterator.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instance paths.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero paths
              are to be returned for every request issued.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

            The choice of MaxObjectCount is client/server dependent but choices
            between 100 and 1000 typically do not have a significant impact on
            either memory or overall efficiency.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        Returns:

          A Python:term:`generator` object. Instance paths can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object. In all cases the instance paths\
          are complete including host and namespace information.

        except the ability to set the response size on each request; response
        size (defined by `MaxObjectCount` is the same for all of the request
        operations in the sequence). There are, limitations in that:

          * The filter function does not exist for ReferenceNames
            so that a request with `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
            attribute will be rejected if the pull operatons do not exist on
            the target WBEM Server.

          * If `ContinueOnError` is set and the pull operations are not
            supported on the server, the request is rejected.

        An open request may be closed while the iteration process is being
        executed by issuing the iterator close() method.

        If the initial request of the operation sequence succeeds, this method
        returns a Python iterator object so that the instances that are
        returned from the server can be retrieved with iterator expressions.

        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.  Not all WBEM
            servers allow FilterQuery filtering for this operation
            because the act of the server filtering requires
            that it generate instances and then discard them.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration
              after sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

          A Python:term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        A generator function to retrieve instances from a WBEM Server.
        This method frees the user of choices between the multiple
        EnumerateInstances/OpenEnumerateInstance methods and reduces
        the enumeration to a pythonic iterator idiom.

        **Experimental:** This method is experimental in this release.

        This method performs either the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenReferenceInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`
        operations (pull operations) or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.References` operation
        (traditional operation) if the WBEM server does not support the
        pull operations. It is an alternative to using these operations
        directly, that automatically uses the pull operations if supported.

        The `use_pull_operations` argument of the
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` constructor can be used to
        override that default behavior to either force the use of pull
        operations or to avoid their use.

        NOTE: This functionality assumes that pull operations may not be
        supported for all of the pull operation types (i.e. operations whose
        name starts with Open). Even if one `Open...` function is not
        implemented (returns `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`) and that operation is
        used as the first request, the code will try the Open... on other pull
        operation types the first time each type is used.

        This method provides all of the controls of the pull operations API
        except the ability to set the response size on each request; response
        size (defined by `MaxObjectCount` is the same for all of the request
        operations in the sequence). There are, limitations in that:

          * The filter function does not exist for ReferenceNames
            so that a request with `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
            attribute will be rejected if the pull operatons do not exist on
            the target WBEM Server.

          * If `ContinueOnError` is set and the pull operations are not
            supported on the server, the request is rejected.

        An open request may be closed while the iteration process is being
        executed by issuing the iterator close() method.

        If the initial request of the operation sequence succeeds, this method
        returns a Python iterator object so that the instances that are
        returned from the server can be retrieved with iterator expressions.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties to be included
            in the returned instances (or classes) (case independent).
            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

          A Python:term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object.

        Raises:

        A generator function to retrieve associator paths from a WBEM Server.
        This method frees the user of choices between the multiple
        AssociatorNames/OpenAssociatorInstancePaths methods and reduces
        the enumeration to a pythonic iterator idiom.

        **Experimental:** This method is experimental in this release.

        This method performs either the
        :meth:`~pywbem.OpenAssociatorInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`) and :meth:`~pywbem.PullInstancePaths operation or
        the:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.AssociatorNames` operation
        (traditional operation) if the WBEM server does not support the
        pull operations. It is an alternative to using these operations
        directly, that automatically uses the pull operations if supported.

        The `use_pull_operations` argument of the
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` constructor can be used to
        override that default behavior to either force the use of pull
        operations or to avoid their use.

        The `use_pull_operations` argument of the
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` constructor can be used to
        override that default behavior to either force the use of pull
        operations or to avoid their use.

        NOTE: This functionality assumes that pull operations may not be
        supported for all of the pull operation types (i.e. operations whose
        name starts with Open). Even if one `Open...` function is not
        implemented (returns `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`) and that operation is
        used as the first request, the code will try the Open... on other pull
        operation types the first time each type is used.

        This method provides all of the controls of the pull operations API
        except the ability to set the response size on each request; response
        size (defined by `MaxObjectCount` is the same for all of the request
        operations in the sequence). There are, limitations in that:

          * The filter function does not exist for ReferenceNames
            so that a request with `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
            attribute will be rejected if the pull operatons do not exist on
            the target WBEM Server.

          * If `ContinueOnError` is set and the pull operations are not
            supported on the server, the request is rejected.

        An open request may be closed while the iteration process is being
        executed by issuing the iterator close() method.

        If the initial request of the operation sequence succeeds, this method
        returns a Python iterator object so that the instances that are
        returned from the server can be retrieved with iterator expressions.

        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.  Not all WBEM
            servers allow FilterQuery filtering for this operation
            because the act of the server filtering requires
            that it generate instances and then discard them.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration
              after sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

          A Python:term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties to be included
            in the returned instances (or classes) (case independent).
            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

          A Python:term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object.

        Raises:

        A generator function to retrieve instances from a WBEM Server.
        This method frees the user of choices between the multiple
        ExecQuery/OpenQueryInstances methods and reduces
        the enumeration to a pythonic iterator idiom.

        **Experimental:** This method is experimental in this release.

        This method performs either the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenQueryInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstances`
        operations (pull operations) or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.ExecQuery` operation
        (traditional operation) if the WBEM server does not support the
        pull operations. It is an alternative to using these operations
        directly, that automatically uses the pull operations if supported.

        The `use_pull_operations` argument of the
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` constructor can be used to
        override that default behavior to either force the use of pull
        operations or to avoid their use.

        NOTE: This functionality assumes that pull operations may not be
        supported for all of the pull operation types (i.e. operations whose
        name starts with Open). Even if one `Open...` function is not
        implemented (returns `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`) and that operation is
        used as the first request, the code will try the Open... on other pull
        operation types the first time each type is used.

        This method provides all of the controls of the pull operations API
        except the ability to set the response size on each request; response
        size (defined by `MaxObjectCount` is the same for all of the request
        operations in the sequence). There are, limitations in that:

          * The filter function does not exist for EnumerateInstances
            so that a request with `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
            attribute will be rejected if the pull operatons do not exist on
            the target WBEM Server.

          * If `ContinueOnError` is set and the pull operations are not
            supported on the server, the request is rejected.

        An open request may be closed while the iteration process is being
        executed by issuing the iterator close() method.

        If the initial request of the operation sequence succeeds, this method
        returns a Python iterator object so that the instances that are
        returned from the server can be retrieved with iterator expressions.

        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          QueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            Name of the query language used in the `Query` parameter, e.g.
            "DMTF:CQL" for CIM Query Language, and "WQL" for WBEM Query
            Language. "DMTF:FQL" is not a valid query language for this
            request.

          Query (:term:`string`):
            Query string in the query language specified in the `QueryLanguage`
            parameter.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            If `None`, the default namespace of the connection object will be
            used.

          ReturnQueryResultClass  (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls whether a class definition is returned.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

          A Python:term:`generator` object. Instances can be retrieved
          by iterating through the object.
          An Instance of the nexted class IterQueryInstancesReturn that
          contains two properties:

          query_result_class: If a result class was requested from by the
          call to InterQueryInstances and one was returned, the CIMClass
          representing this class is returned.  Otherwise, None is returned

          generator: That defines a generator for the instances returned from
          whichever lower level function is called. The instances are
          accessed using this generator (ex. for inst in rtn.generator:)

        Open an enumeration session to enumerate the instance paths of
        instances of a class (including instances of its subclasses) in
        a namespace.

        This method performs the OpenEnumerateInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns status on the
        enumeration session and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` request to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths
        or the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration`
        request to close the enumeration session early.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter. Not all WBEM
            servers allow FilterQuery filtering for this operation
            (i.e. return the CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED exception when filtering
            is specified) because the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances and then discard them.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :class:`py:namedtuple` object containing the following named
            items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
              Representations of the initial set of enumerated instance paths,
              with their attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted
              after returning the initial set of enumerated instances.

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              Identifies the opened enumeration session. The client must
              provide this value for subsequent operations on this
              enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in

            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and

              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties to be
            included in the returned instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :class:`py:namedtuple` object containing the following named
            items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the initial set of enumerated instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted
              after returning the initial set of enumerated instances.

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              Identifies the opened enumeration session. The client must
              provide this value for subsequent operations on this
              enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instance paths of
        the association instances that reference a source instance.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenReferenceInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstances` request to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths
        or the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration`
        request to close the enumeration session early.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.  Not all WBEM
            servers allow FilterQuery filtering for this operation
            because the act of the server filtering requires
            that it generate instances and then discard them.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :class:`py:namedtuple` object containing the following named
            items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):

              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted
              after returning the initial set of enumerated instances.

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              Identifies the opened enumeration session. The client must
              provide this value for subsequent operations on this

            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string` or :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a  string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :class:`py:namedtuple` object containing the following named
            items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the initial set of enumerated instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted
              after returning the initial set of enumerated instances.

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              Identifies the opened enumeration session. The client must
              provide this value for subsequent operations on this
              enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instance paths of the
        instances associated to a source instance.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenAssociatorInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` request to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths
        or the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration`
        request to close the enumeration session early.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter. Not all WBEM
            servers allow FilterQuery filtering for this operation
            (i.e. return the CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED exception when filtering
            is specified) because the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances and then discard them.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error

              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :class:`py:namedtuple` object containing the following named
            items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):

              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted
              after returning the initial set of enumerated instances.

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):

              provide this value for subsequent operations on this
              enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instances associated
        to a source instance.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenAssociatorInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        The subsequent operation after this open is successful
        and result.eos = False must be either the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstances` request
        or the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration`
        request.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string` or :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a  string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the name of the query language
            used for the `FilterQuery` parameter. The DMTF defined language
            (FQL) (:term:`DSP0212`) is specified as 'DMTF:FQL'.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            A string defining the query that is to be sent
            to the WBEM server using the query language defined by
            the `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :class:`py:namedtuple` object containing the following named
            items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the initial set of enumerated instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted
              after returning the initial set of enumerated instances.

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              Identifies the opened enumeration session. The client must
              provide this value for subsequent operations on this
              enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Parameters:

            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instance, as follows:

              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string` or :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a  string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instance (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters

        Returns:

            A :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` object that is a representation of
            the retrieved instance.
            Its `path` attribute is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source

            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string` or :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a  string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes) (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.

            * For class-level usage: The class path of the source class, as a
              :term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object:

              If specified as a string, the string is interpreted as a class
              name in the default namespace of the connection
              (case independent).

              If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
              attribute will be ignored. If this object does not specify
              a namespace, the default namespace of the connection is used.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.

              Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            * For class-level usage: The class path of the source class, as a
              :term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object:

              If specified as a string, the string is interpreted as a class
              name in the default namespace of the connection
              (case independent).

              If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
              attribute will be ignored. If this object does not specify
              a namespace, the default namespace of the connection is used.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on it being implemented by WBEM servers.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string` or :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a  string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes) (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation

        Invoke a method on a target instance or on a target class.

        The methods that can be invoked are static and non-static methods
        defined in a class (also known as *extrinsic* methods).
        Static methods can be invoked on instances and on classes.
        Non-static methods can be invoked only on instances.

        This method performs the extrinsic method invocation operation

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Input parameters for the CIM method can be specified using the
        `Params` parameter, and using keyword parameters.
        The overall list of input parameters is formed from the list of
        parameters specified in `Params` (preserving its order), followed by
        the set of keyword parameters (in any order). There is no checking for
        duplicate parameter names.

            "DMTF:CQL" for CIM Query Language, and "WQL" for WBEM Query
            Language.

          Query (:term:`string`):
            Query string in the query language specified in the `QueryLanguage`
            parameter.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            If `None`, the default namespace of the connection object will be
