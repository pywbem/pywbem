class WBEMConnection(object):  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    """
    A client's connection to a WBEM server. This is the main class of the
    WBEM client library API.

    The connection object knows a default CIM namespace, which is used when no
    namespace is specified on subsequent WBEM operations (that support
    specifying namespaces). Thus, the connection object can be used as a
    connection to multiple CIM namespaces on a WBEM server (when the namespace
    is specified on subsequent operations), or as a connection to only the
    default namespace (this allows omitting the namespace on subsequent
    operations).

    As usual in HTTP, there is no persistent TCP connection; the connectedness
    provided by this class is only conceptual. That is, the creation of the
    connection object does not cause any interaction with the WBEM server, and
    each subsequent WBEM operation performs an independent, state-less
    HTTP/HTTPS request.

    After creating a :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object, various methods
    may be called on the object, which cause WBEM operations to be issued to
    the WBEM server. See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of these methods.

    CIM elements such as instances or classes are represented as Python objects
    (see :ref:`CIM objects`). The caller does not need to know about the CIM-XML
    encoding of CIM elements and protocol payload that is used underneath (It
    should be possible to use a different WBEM protocol below this layer without
    disturbing any callers).

    The connection remembers the XML of the last request and last reply if
    debugging is turned on via the :attr:`debug` attribute of the
    connection object.
    This may be useful in debugging: If a problem occurs, you can examine the
    :attr:`last_request` and :attr:`last_reply` attributes of the
    connection object.
    These are the prettified XML of request and response, respectively.
    The real request and response that are sent and received are available in
    the :attr:`last_raw_request` and :attr:`last_raw_reply` attributes
    of the connection object.

    WBEMConnection objects can record the operations performed by calling
    :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` methods that interact with a WBEM server
    using *operation recorders*, at the level of method calls and returns, and
    at the level of CIM-XML requests and responses.
    The :class:`~pywbem.LogOperationRecorder` class records the operations in
    the Python logging facility. This recorder is activated through the
    `connection` parameter of :func:`~pywbem._logging.configure_logger`.
    The :class:`~pywbem.TestClientRecorder` class records the operations in a
    file in the YAML format suitable for the test_client.py unit test program.
    Before version 0.11.0, pywbem supported only a single operation recorder
    and activating/deactivating the recorder was a simple matter of setting the
    :attr:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.operation_recorder` attribute.
    Starting with pywbem version 0.11.0, pywbem added support for multiple
    operation recorders and deprecated the
    :attr:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.operation_recorder` attribute. The
    :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.add_operation_recorder` method is now used
    to add an operation recorder to a connection, and the
    :attr:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.operation_recorders` property is used to
    retrieve the current operation recorders of a connection.

    The methods of this class may raise the following exceptions:

    * Exceptions indicating processing errors:

      - :exc:`~pywbem.ConnectionError` - A connection with the WBEM server
        could not be established or broke down.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.AuthError` - Authentication failed with the WBEM server.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.HTTPError` - HTTP error (bad status code) received from
        WBEM server.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.ParseError` - The response from the WBEM server cannot
        be parsed (for example, invalid characters or UTF-8 sequences,
        ill-formed XML, or invalid CIM-XML).

      - :exc:`~pywbem.CIMError` - The WBEM server returned an error response
        with a CIM status code.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.TimeoutError` - The WBEM server did not respond in time
        and the client timed out.

    * Exceptions indicating programming errors:

      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.TypeError`
      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.KeyError`
      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError`
      - :exc:`~py:exceptions.AttributeError`
      - ... possibly others ...

      Exceptions indicating programming errors should not happen. If you think
      the reason such an exception is raised lies in pywbem,

        Parameters:

          url (:term:`string`):
            URL of the WBEM server, in the format:

              ``[{scheme}://]{host}[:{port}]``

            The following URL schemes are supported:

            * ``https``: Causes HTTPS to be used.
            * ``http``: Causes HTTP to be used.

            The host can be specified in any of the usual formats:

            * a short or fully qualified DNS hostname
            * a literal (= dotted) IPv4 address
            * a literal IPv6 address, formatted as defined in :term:`RFC3986`
              with the extensions for zone identifiers as defined in
              :term:`RFC6874`, supporting ``-`` (minus) for the delimiter
              before the zone ID string, as an additional choice to ``%25``.

            If no port is specified in the URL, the default ports are:

            * If HTTPS is used, port 5989.
            * If HTTP is used, port 5988.

            Examples for some URL formats:

            * ``"https://10.11.12.13:6988"``:
              Use HTTPS to port 6988 on host 10.11.12.13
            * ``"https://mysystem.acme.org"``:
              Use HTTPS to port 5989 on host mysystem.acme.org
            * ``"10.11.12.13"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 on host 10.11.12.13
            * ``"http://[2001:db8::1234]:15988"``:
              Use HTTP to port 15988 on host 2001:db8::1234
            * ``"http://[::ffff.10.11.12.13]"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 on host ::ffff.10.11.12.13 (an
              IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
            * ``"http://[2001:db8::1234%25eth0]"`` or
              ``"http://[2001:db8::1234-eth0]"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 to host 2001:db8::1234 (a link-local IPv6
              address) using zone identifier eth0

          creds (:func:`py:tuple` of userid, password):
            Credentials for HTTP authentication with the WBEM server, as a
            tuple(userid, password), with:

            * userid (:term:`string`):
              Userid for authenticating with the WBEM server.

            * password (:term:`string`):
              Password for that userid.

            If `None`, the client will not generate ``Authorization`` headers
            in the HTTP request. Otherwise, the client will generate an
            ``Authorization`` header using HTTP Basic Authentication.

            See :ref:`Authentication types` for an overview.

          default_namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used by default (if no namespace
            is specified for an operation).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            `None` will cause the following namespace to be used as a default
            namespace: :data:`~pywbem.cim_constants.DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`.

          x509 (:class:`py:dict`):
            :term:`X.509` client certificate and key file to be presented
            to the WBEM server during the TLS/SSL handshake.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            If `None`, no client certificate is presented to the server,
            resulting in 1-way authentication to be used.

            Otherwise, the client certificate is presented to the server,
            resulting in 2-way authentication to be used.
            This parameter must be a dictionary containing the following
            two items:

              * ``"cert_file"`` (:term:`string`):
                The file path of a file containing an :term:`X.509` client
                certificate.

              * ``"key_file"`` (:term:`string`):
                The file path of a file containing the private key belonging to
                the public key that is part of the :term:`X.509` certificate
                file.

            See :ref:`Authentication types` for an overview.

          verify_callback (:term:`callable`):
            Registers a callback function that will be called to verify the
            X.509 server certificate returned by the WBEM server during the
            TLS/SSL handshake, in addition to the validation already performed
            by the TLS/SSL support.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            Note that the validation performed by the TLS/SSL support already
            includes the usual validation, so that normally a callback function
            does not need to be used. See
            :ref:`Verification of the X.509 server certificate` for details.

            Warning: This parameter is not used when the python environment
            is Python 3 because the ssl module does not support it.

            If `None`, no such callback function will be registered.

            The specified function will be called for the returned certificate,
            and for each of the certificates in its chain of trust.

            See `M2Crypto.SSL.Context.set_verify` for details, as well as
            http://blog.san-ss.com.ar/2012/05/validating-ssl-certificate-in-python.html):

            The callback function must take five parameters:

            * the `M2Crypto.SSL.Connection` object that triggered the
              verification.

            * an `OpenSSL.crypto.X509` object representing the certificate
              to be validated (the returned certificate or one of the
              certificates in its chain of trust).

            * an integer containing the error number (0 in case no error) of
              any validation error detected by `M2Crypto`.
              You can find their meaning in the OpenSSL documentation.

            * an integer indicating the depth (=position) of the certificate to
              be validated (the one in the second parameter) in the chain of
              trust of the returned certificate. A value of 0 indicates
              that the returned certificate is currently validated; any other
              value indicates the distance of the currently validated
              certificate to the returned certificate in its chain of trust.

            * an integer that indicates whether the validation of the
              certificate specified in the second parameter passed or did not
              pass the validation by `M2Crypto`. A value of 1 indicates a
              successful validation and 0 an unsuccessful one.

            The callback function must return `True` if the verification
            passes and `False` otherwise.

          ca_certs (:term:`string`):
            Location of CA certificates (trusted certificates) for
            verifying the X.509 server certificate returned by the WBEM server.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            The parameter value must be one of:

            * a path to a file containing one or more CA certificates in
              PEM format. See the description of `CAfile` in the OpenSSL
              `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations`_ function for details.

            * a path to a directory with files each of which contains one CA
              certificate in PEM format. See the description of `CApath` in the
              OpenSSL `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations`_ function for details.

            If `None`, the directory path of the first existing directory from
            the list in :data:`~pywbem.cim_http.DEFAULT_CA_CERT_PATHS` will be
            used as a default.

            .. _`SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations`: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html

          no_verification (:class:`py:bool`):
            Disables verification of the X.509 server certificate returned by
            the WBEM server during TLS/SSL handshake, disables verification of
            the hostname, and disables the invocation of a verification function
            specified in `verify_callback`.

            If `True`, verification is disabled; otherwise, verification is
            enabled.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            Disabling the verification of the server certificate is insecure
            and should be avoided!

          timeout (:term:`number`):
            *New in pywbem 0.8.*

            Timeout in seconds, for requests sent to the server. If the server
            did not respond within the timeout duration, the socket for the
            connection will be closed, causing a :exc:`~pywbem.TimeoutError` to
            be raised.

            A value of `None` means that the connection uses the standard
            timeout behavior of Python sockets, which can be between several
            minutes and much longer. Because this is somewhat unpredictable,
            it is recommended to specify a value for the timeout.

            A value of ``0`` means the timeout is very short, and does not
            really make any sense.

            Note that not all situations can be handled within this timeout, so
            for some issues, operations may take longer before raising an
            exception.

          use_pull_operations (:class:`py:bool`):
            **Experimental** *New in pywbem 0.11 as experimental.*

            Controls the use of pull operations in any `Iter...()` methods.

            `None` means that the `Iter...()` methods will attempt a pull
            operation first, and if the WBEM server does not support it, will
            use a traditional operation from then on, on this connection.
            This detection is performed for each pull operation separately, in
            order to accomodate WBEM servers that support only some of the pull
            operations. This will work on any WBEM server whether it supports
            no, some, or all pull operations.

            `True` means that the `Iter...()` methods will only use pull
            operations. If the WBEM server does not support pull operations, a
            :exc:`~pywbem.CIMError` with status code `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`
            will be raised.

            `False` (default) means that the `Iter...()` methods will only use
            traditional operations.

          stats_enabled (:class:`py:bool`):
            *New in pywbem 0.11 as experimental, renamed from `enable_stats`
            and finalized in 0.12.*

            Initial enablement status for maintaining statistics about the
            WBEM operations executed via this connection. See the

            :ref:`WBEM operation statistics` section for details.

            Simple name (ex. `'api'`) of the single pywbem logger this method
            should affect, or `'all'` to affect all pywbem loggers.

            Must be one of the strings in
            :data:`~pywbem._logging.LOGGER_SIMPLE_NAMES`.

          log_dest (:term:`string`):
            Log destination for the affected pywbem loggers, controlling the
            configuration of its Python logging parameters (log handler,
            message format, and log level).

            If `None`, the Python logging parameters of the loggers will not be
            changed.

          detail_level (:term:`string` or :class:`int` or `None`):
            Detail level for the data in each log record that is generated by
            the affected pywbem loggers.

            If it is a :term:`string`, it must be one of the strings in
            :data:`~pywbem._logging.LOG_DETAIL_LEVELS` and the loggers will
            be configured for the corresponding detail level.

            If it is an :class:`int`, it defines the maximum size of the log
            records created and the loggers will be configured to output all
            available information up to that size.

            If `None`, the detail level configuration will not be changed.

          log_filename (:term:`string`):
            Path name of the log file (required if the log destination is
            `'file'`; otherwise ignored).

          connection (:class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` or :class:`py:bool` or `None`):
            WBEM connection(s) that should be affected for activation and for
            setting the detail level.

            If it is a :class:`py:bool`, the information for activating logging
            and for the detail level of the affected loggers will be stored for
            use by subsequently created :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` objects.
            A value of `True` will store the information to activate the
            connections for logging, and will add the detail level for the
            logger(s).
            A value of `False` will reset the stored information for future
            connections to be deactivated with no detail levels specified.

            If it is a :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object, logging will be
            activated for that WBEM connection only and the specified detail
            level will be set for the affected pywbem loggers on the
            connection.

            If `None`, no WBEM connection will be activated for logging.

        propagate (:class:`py:bool`): Flag controlling whether the
          affected pywbem logger should propagate log events to its
          parent loggers.

        Enumerate the instances of a class (including instances of its
        subclasses) in a namespace.

        This method performs the EnumerateInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
            attribute will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A list of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` objects that are
            representations of the enumerated instances.

            The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
            object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
            attributes set as follows:

            * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
            * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
            * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
            * `host`: `None`, indicating the WBEM server is unspecified.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instance (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

        Modify the property values of an instance.

        This method performs the ModifyInstance operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        The `PropertyList` parameter determines the set of properties that are
        designated to be modified (see its description for details).

        The properties provided in the `ModifiedInstance` parameter specify
        the new property values for the properties that are designated to be
        modified.

        Pywbem sends the property values provided in the `ModifiedInstance`
        parameter to the WBEM server as provided; it does not add any default
        values for properties not provided but designated to be modified, nor
        does it reduce the properties by those not designated to be modified.

        The properties that are actually modified by the WBEM server as a result
        of this operation depend on a number of things:

        * The WBEM server will reject modification requests for key properties
          and for properties that are not exposed by the creation class of the
          target instance.

        * The WBEM server may consider some properties as read-only, as a
          result of requirements at the CIM modeling level (schema or
          management profiles), or as a result of an implementation decision.

          Note that the WRITE qualifier on a property is not a safe indicator
          as to whether the property can actually be modified. It is an
          expression at the level of the CIM schema that may or may not be
          considered in DMTF management profiles or in implementations.
          Specifically, a qualifier value of True on a property does not
          guarantee modifiability of the property, and a value of False does
          not prevent modifiability.

        * The WBEM server may detect invalid new values or conflicts resulting
          from the new property values and may reject modification of a property
          for such reasons.

        If the WBEM server rejects modification of a property for any reason,
        it will cause this operation to fail and will not modify any property
        on the target instance. If this operation succeeds, all properties
        designated to be modified have their new values (see the description
        of the `ModifiedInstance` parameter for details on how the new values
        are determined).

        Note that properties (including properties not designated to be
        modified) may change their values as an indirect result of this
        operation. For example, a property that was not designated to be
        modified may be derived from another property that was modified, and
        may show a changed value due to that.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ModifiedInstance (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
            A representation of the modified instance, also indicating its
            instance path.

            The `path` attribute of this object identifies the instance to be
            modified. Its `keybindings` attribute is required. If its
            `namespace` attribute is `None`, the default namespace of the
            connection will be used. Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            The `classname` attribute of the instance path and the `classname`
            attribute of the instance must specify the same class name.

            The properties defined in this object specify the new property
            values (including `None` for NULL). If a property is designated to
            be modified but is not specified in this object, the WBEM server
            will use the default value of the property declaration if specified
            (including `None`), and otherwise may update the property to any
            value (including `None`).

            Typically, this object has been retrieved by other operations,
            such as :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.GetInstance`.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be modified as specified in the
            `ModifiedInstance` parameter, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers not modified.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are modified if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be modified.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            This parameter defines which properties are designated to be
            modified.

            This parameter is an iterable specifying the names of the
            properties, or a string that specifies a single property name. In
            all cases, the property names are matched case insensitively.
            The specified properties are designated to be modified. Properties
            not specified are not designated to be modified.

            An empty iterable indicates that no properties are designated to be
            modified.

            If `None`, DSP0200 states that the properties with values different
            from the current values in the instance are designated to be
            modified, but for all practical purposes this is equivalent to
            stating that all properties exposed by the instance are designated
            to be modified.

          extra :

          * default namespace of the connection.

        Parameters:

          NewInstance (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
            A representation of the CIM instance to be created.

            The `classname` attribute of this object specifies the creation
            class for the new instance.

            Apart from utilizing its namespace, the `path` attribute is ignored.

            The `properties` attribute of this object specifies initial
            property values for the new CIM instance.

            Instance-level qualifiers have been deprecated in CIM, so any
            qualifier values specified using the `qualifiers` attribute
            of this object will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            *New in pywbem 0.9.*

            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            If `None`, defaults to the namespace in the `path` attribute of the
            `NewInstance` parameter, or to the default namespace of the
            connection.

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object that is the instance
            path of the new instance, with classname, keybindings and
            namespace set.

        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ObjectName:
            The object path of the source object, selecting instance-level or
            class-level use of this operation, as follows:

            * For selecting instance-level use: The instance path of the
              source instance, as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object.
              If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
              of the connection is used.
              Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            * For selecting class-level use: The class path of the source
              class, as a :term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object:

              If specified as a string, the string is interpreted as a class
              name in the default namespace of the connection
              (case independent).

              If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
              attribute will be ignored. If this object does not specify
              a namespace, the default namespace of the connection is used.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` for
            instance-level use. WBEM servers may either implement this
            parameter as specified, or may treat any specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes) (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            : The returned list of objects depend on the usage:

            * For instance-level use: A list of
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` objects that are representations
              of the associated instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                information.

            * For class-level use: A list of :func:`py:tuple` of
              (classpath, class) objects that are representations of the
              associated classes.

              Each tuple represents one class and has these items:

              * classpath (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`): The class
                path of the class, with its attributes set as follows:

                * `classname`: Name of the class.
                * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the class.
                * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                  the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                  information.

              * class (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClass`): The representation of the

        This method performs the References operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ObjectName:
            The object path of the source object, selecting instance-level or
            class-level use of this operation, as follows:

            * For selecting instance-level use: The instance path of the
              source instance, as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object.
              If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
              of the connection is used.
              Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            * For selecting class-level use: The class path of the source
              class, as a :term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object:

              If specified as a string, the string is interpreted as a class
              name in the default namespace of the connection
              (case independent).

              If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
              attribute will be ignored. If this object does not specify
              a namespace, the default namespace of the connection is used.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` for
            instance-level use. WBEM servers may either implement this
            parameter as specified, or may treat any specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes) (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

              :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` objects that are representations
              of the referencing association instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its

              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                information.

            * For class-level use: A list of :func:`py:tuple` of
              (classpath, class) objects that are representations of the
              referencing association classes.

              Each tuple represents one class and has these items:

              * classpath (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`): The class
                path of the class, with its attributes set as follows:

                * `classname`: Name of the class.
                * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the class.
                * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                  the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                  information.

              * class (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClass`): The representation of the
                class, with its `path` attribute set to the `classpath` tuple
                item.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        Enumerate the instances of a class (including instances of its
        subclasses) in a namespace,
        using the corresponding pull operations if supported by the WBEM server
        or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation, and using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instances from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instances that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstances`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` constructor parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

            The choice of MaxObjectCount is client/server dependent but choices
            between 100 and 1000 typically do not have a significant impact on
            either memory or overall efficiency.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

            ValueError: Invalid parameters provided.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instances.
          These instances include an instance path that has its host and
          namespace components set.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        Enumerate the instance paths of instances of a class (including
        instances of its subclasses) in a namespace,
        using the corresponding pull operations if supported by the WBEM server
        or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation, and using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instance paths from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instance paths that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstancePaths` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstanceNames`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` constructor parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instance paths.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero paths
              are to be returned for every request issued.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

            The choice of MaxObjectCount is client/server dependent but choices
            between 100 and 1000 typically do not have a significant impact on
            either memory or overall efficiency.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instance paths.
          These instance paths have their host and namespace components set.

        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

            Many WBEM servers do not support this request attribute so that
            setting it to `True` is NOT recommended except in special cases.

            If this parameter is `True` and the traditional operation is used
            by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be raised.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instances.
          These instances include an instance path that has its host and
          namespace components set.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        Retrieve the instance paths of the instances associated to a source
        instance,
        using the corresponding pull operations if supported by the WBEM server
        or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation, and using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instance paths from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instance paths that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenAssociatorInstancePaths` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.AssociatorNames`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` constructor parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        Retrieve the association instances that reference a source instance,
        using the corresponding pull operations if supported by the WBEM server
        or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation, and using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instances from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instances that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenReferenceInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.References`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` constructor parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        Retrieve the instance paths of the association instances that reference
        a source instance,
        using the corresponding pull operations if supported by the WBEM server
        or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation, and using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instance paths from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instance paths that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenReferenceInstancePaths` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.ReferenceNames`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` constructor parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration
              after sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instance paths.
          These instance paths have their host and namespace components set.

        Raises:

        Execute a query in a namespace,
        using the corresponding pull operations if supported by the WBEM server
        or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation, and using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        Other than the other Iter...() methods, this method does not return
        a generator object directly, but as a property of the returned object.
        The reason for this design is the additionally returned query
        result class. The generator property in the returned object is a
        generator object that returns the instances in the query result one by
        one (using :keyword:`yield`) when the caller iterates through the
        generator object. This design causes the entire query result to be
        materialized, even if pull operations are used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenQueryInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstances`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.ExecQuery`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` constructor parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          QueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            Name of the query language used in the `Query` parameter, e.g.
            "DMTF:CQL" for CIM Query Language, and "WQL" for WBEM Query
            Language. Because this is not a filter query, "DMTF:FQL" is not a
            valid query language for this request.

          Query (:term:`string`):
            Query string in the query language specified in the `QueryLanguage`
            parameter.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the default namespace of the connection object will be
            used.

          ReturnQueryResultClass (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls whether a class definition describing the returned
            instances will be returned.

            `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

            `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code

              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this

            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            `None`, if a query result class was not requested.

          * **generator** (:term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):

            A generator object that iterates the CIM instances representing the

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        Open an enumeration session to enumerate the instances of a class
        (including instances of its subclasses) in a namespace.

        This method performs the OpenEnumerateInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath` method to
        retrieve the next set of instances or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the retrieved instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        Open an enumeration session to enumerate the instance paths of
        instances of a class (including instances of its subclasses) in
        a namespace.

        This method performs the OpenEnumerateInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns status on the
        enumeration session and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` method to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
              Representations of the retrieved instance paths, with their
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instances associated
        to a source instance.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenAssociatorInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath` method to
        retrieve the next set of instances or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the retrieved instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instance paths of the
        instances associated to a source instance.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenAssociatorInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` method to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
              Representations of the retrieved instance paths, with their
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.

                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the association instances
        that reference a source instance.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenReferenceInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath` method to
        retrieve the next set of instances or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the retrieved instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instance paths of
        the association instances that reference a source instance.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenReferenceInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` method to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The

            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        Open an enumeration session to execute a query in a namespace and to
        retrieve the instances representing the query result.

        This method performs the OpenQueryInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally CIM instances representing the query result.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstances` method to
        retrieve the next set of instances or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            Name of the query language used in the `FilterQuery` parameter,
            e.g. "DMTF:CQL" for CIM Query Language, and "WQL" for WBEM Query
            Language. Because this is not a filter query, "DMTF:FQL" is not a
            valid query language for this request.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            Query string in the query language specified in the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the default namespace of the connection object will be
            used.

          ReturnQueryResultClass (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls whether a class definition describing the returned
            instances will be returned.

            `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :attr:`~pywbem.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the retrieved instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is `None`, because query results are not addressable
              CIM instances.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: The inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

            * **query_result_class** (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClass`):
              If the `ReturnQueryResultClass` parameter is True, this tuple
              item contains a class definition that defines the properties
              of each row (instance) of the query result. Otherwise, `None`.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        Retrieve the next set of instance paths from an open enumeration
        session.

        This operation can only be used on enumeration sessions that have been
        opened by one of the following methods:

        * :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstancePaths`
        * :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenAssociatorInstancePaths`
        * :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenReferenceInstancePaths`

        This method performs the PullInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          context (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace)
            A context object identifying the open enumeration session, including
            its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This object must
            have been returned by the previous open or pull operation for this
            enumeration session.

            The tuple items are:

            * server_context (:term:`string`):
              Enumeration context string returned by the server. This
              string is opaque for the client.
            * namespace (:term:`string`):
              Name of the CIM namespace being used for this enumeration session.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`)
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server shall return
            for this request. This parameter is required for each
            Pull request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to reset the interoperation timer.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Keyword Arguments:

          extra :
            Additional keyword arguments are passed as additional operation
            parameters to the WBEM server.
            Note that :term:`DSP0200` does not define any additional parameters
            for this operation.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
              Representations of the retrieved instance paths, with their
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:func:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.
