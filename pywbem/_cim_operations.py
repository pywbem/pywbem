class WBEMConnection(object):  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    """
    A client's connection to a WBEM server or WBEM listener. This is the main
    class of the WBEM client library API.

    This class is used for communication with WBEM servers and WBEM listeners,
    because the communication mechanisms are very similar. However, a
    particular object of this class will connect to only one target which is
    either a WBEM server or a WBEM listener, but never both.

    When targeting a WBEM server, the connection object knows a default CIM
    namespace, which is used when no namespace is specified on subsequent
    WBEM operations (that support specifying namespaces). Thus, the connection
    object can be used as a connection to multiple CIM namespaces on a
    WBEM server (when the namespace is specified on subsequent operations),
    or as a connection to only the default namespace (this allows omitting the
    namespace on subsequent operations).

    As usual in HTTP, there is no persistent TCP connection; the connectedness
    provided by this class is only conceptual. That is, the creation of the
    connection object does not cause any interaction with the WBEM server or
    WBEM listener, and each subsequent WBEM operation performs an independent,
    state-less HTTP/HTTPS request. However, usage of the `requests` Python
    package causes the underlying resources such as sockets to be pooled.
    A :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.close` method closes the underlying
    session of the `requests` package, releasing any sockets.

    The WBEMConnection class can also be used as a context manager, which
    causes the connection to be closed at context manager exit:

    .. code-block:: python

        with WBEMConnection('https://myserver') as conn:
            conn.EnumerateInstances('CIM_Foo')

    The :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` class supports connection through
    HTTP and SOCKS proxies, by utilizing the proxy support in the `requests`
    Python package.

    After creating a :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object, various methods
    may be called on the object, which cause WBEM operations to be issued to
    the WBEM server or WBEM listener. See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of
    these methods. Each operation method describes whether it can be used
    with a WBEM server or with a WBEM listener.

    CIM elements such as instances or classes are represented as Python objects
    (see :ref:`CIM objects`). The caller does not need to know about the CIM-XML
    encoding of CIM elements and protocol payload that is used underneath (It
    should be possible to use a different WBEM protocol below this layer without
    disturbing any callers).

    The connection remembers the XML of the last request and last reply if
    debugging is turned on via the :attr:`debug` attribute of the
    connection object.
    This may be useful in debugging: If a problem occurs, you can examine the
    :attr:`last_request` and :attr:`last_reply` attributes of the
    connection object.
    These are the prettified XML of request and response, respectively.
    The real request and response that are sent and received are available in
    the :attr:`last_raw_request` and :attr:`last_raw_reply` attributes
    of the connection object.

    The methods of this class may raise the following exceptions:

    * Exceptions indicating operational errors:

      - :exc:`~pywbem.ConnectionError` - A connection with the WBEM server
        or WBEM listener could not be established or broke down.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.AuthError` - Authentication failed with the WBEM server.
        This exception cannot occur when targeting a WBEM listener.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.TimeoutError` - The WBEM server or WBEM listener did not
        respond in time and the client timed out.

      Such exceptions can typically be resolved by the client user or server
      admin.

    * Exceptions indicating server-side issues:

      - :exc:`~pywbem.HTTPError` - HTTP error (bad status code) received from
        WBEM server or WBEM listener.

      - :exc:`~pywbem.CIMXMLParseError` - The response from the WBEM server
        or WBEM listener cannot be parsed because it is invalid CIM-XML
        (for example, a required attribute is missing on an XML element).

      - :exc:`~pywbem.XMLParseError` - The response from the WBEM server or
        WBEM listener cannot be parsed because it is invalid XML (for example,
        invalid characters or UTF-8 sequences, or ill-formed XML).

      Such exceptions nearly always indicate an issue with the implementation
      of the WBEM server or WBEM listener.

    * Other exceptions:

      - :exc:`~pywbem.CIMError` - The WBEM server or WBEM listener returned an
        error response  with a CIM status code.

      Depending on the nature of the request, and on the CIM status code, the
      reason may be a client user error (e.g. incorrect class name) or
      a server side issue (e.g. some internal error in the server or listener).

    * Exceptions indicating programming errors (in pywbem or by the user):

      - :exc:`py:TypeError`
      - :exc:`py:KeyError`
      - :exc:`py:ValueError`
      - :exc:`py:AttributeError`
      - ... possibly others ...

      Exceptions indicating programming errors should not happen. If you think
      the reason such an exception is raised lies in pywbem,
      `report a bug <https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/issues>`_.

        Parameters:

          url (:term:`string`):
            URL of the WBEM server or WBEM listener, in the format:

              ``[{scheme}://]{host}[:{port}]``

            Possibly present trailing path segments in the URL are ignored.

            The following URL schemes are supported:

            * ``http``: Causes HTTP to be used (default).
            * ``https``: Causes HTTPS to be used.

            The host can be specified in any of the usual formats:

            * a short or fully qualified DNS hostname
            * a literal (= dotted) IPv4 address
            * a literal IPv6 address, formatted as defined in :term:`RFC3986`
              with the extensions for zone identifiers as defined in
              :term:`RFC6874`, supporting ``-`` (minus) for the delimiter
              before the zone ID string, as an additional choice to ``%25``.

            If no port is specified in the URL, it defaults to:

            * Port 5988 for URL scheme ``http``
            * Port 5989 for URL scheme ``https``

            For WBEM listeners, the port usually different and should therefore
            be specified in the URL.

            Examples for some URL formats:

            * ``"https://10.11.12.13:6989"``:
              Use HTTPS to port 6989 on host 10.11.12.13
            * ``"https://mysystem.acme.org"``:
              Use HTTPS to port 5989 on host mysystem.acme.org
            * ``"10.11.12.13"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 on host 10.11.12.13
            * ``"http://[2001:db8::1234]:15988"``:
              Use HTTP to port 15988 on host 2001:db8::1234
            * ``"http://[::ffff.10.11.12.13]"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 on host ::ffff.10.11.12.13 (an
              IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
            * ``"http://[2001:db8::1234%25eth0]"`` or
              ``"http://[2001:db8::1234-eth0]"``:
              Use HTTP to port 5988 to host 2001:db8::1234 (a link-local IPv6
              address) using zone identifier eth0

          creds (:class:`py:tuple` of userid, password):
            Credentials for HTTP authentication with the WBEM server, as a
            tuple(userid, password), with:

            * userid (:term:`string`):
              Userid for authenticating with the WBEM server.

            * password (:term:`string`):
              Password for that userid.

            If `None`, the client will not generate ``Authorization`` headers
            in the HTTP request. Otherwise, the client will generate an
            ``Authorization`` header using HTTP Basic Authentication.

            See :ref:`Authentication types` for an overview.

            This parameter will be ignored when targeting a WBEM listener.

          default_namespace (:term:`string`):
            Default CIM namespace for this connection.

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be set to
            the built-in default namespace |DEFAULT_NAMESPACE|.

            The default namespace of the connection is used if no namespace
            or a namespace of `None` is specified for an operation.

            This parameter will be ignored when targeting a WBEM listener.

          x509 (:class:`py:dict`):
            :term:`X.509` client certificate and key file to be presented
            to the WBEM server or WBEM listener during the TLS/SSL handshake.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            If `None`, no client certificate is presented to the server or
            listener, resulting in TLS/SSL 1-way authentication to be used.

            Otherwise, the client certificate is presented to the server or
            listener, resulting in TLS/SSL 2-way authentication to be used.
            This parameter must be a dictionary containing the following
            two items:

              * ``"cert_file"`` (:term:`string`):
                The file path of a file containing an :term:`X.509` client
                certificate. Required. If the file does not exist,
                :exc:`py:IOError` will be raised.

              * ``"key_file"`` (:term:`string`):
                The file path of a file containing the private key belonging to
                the public key that is part of the :term:`X.509` certificate
                file. Optional; if omitted or `None`, the private key must
                be in the file specified with ``"cert_file"``. If specified
                but the file does not exist, :exc:`py:IOError` will
                be raised.

            The dictionary is copied.

            See :ref:`Authentication types` for an overview.

          ca_certs (:term:`string`):
            Selects the CA certificates (trusted certificates) for
            verifying the X.509 server certificate returned by the WBEM server
            or WBEM listener.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used or when the
            `no_verification` parameter is set to disable verification.

            The parameter value must be one of:

            * :term:`string`: A path to a file containing one or more CA
              certificates in PEM format. See the description of `CAfile` in
              the OpenSSL `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations`_ function for
              details. If the file does not exist,
              :exc:`py:IOError` will be raised.

            * :term:`string`: A path to a directory with files each of which
              contains one CA certificate in PEM format. See the description
              of `CApath` in the OpenSSL `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations`_
              function for details. If the directory does not exist,
              :exc:`py:IOError` will be raised.

            * `None` (default): Use the certificates provided by the
              `certifi Python package`_. This package provides the certificates
              from the `Mozilla Included CA Certificate List`_.

            .. _`certifi Python package`: https://certifi.io/en/latest/

            .. _`Mozilla Included CA Certificate List`: https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates

            .. _`SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations`: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html

          no_verification (:class:`py:bool`):
            Disables verification of the X.509 server certificate returned by
            the WBEM server or WBEM listener during TLS/SSL handshake, and
            disables verification of the hostname.

            If `True`, verification is disabled; otherwise, verification is
            enabled.

            This parameter is ignored when HTTP is used.

            Disabling the verification of the server certificate is insecure
            and should be avoided!

          timeout (:term:`number`):
            Timeout in seconds, for completing a CIM operation to a server or a
            CIM indication delivery to a listener.

            *New in pywbem 0.8.*

            If the CIM operation or CIM indication delivery could not be
            completed within the specified timeout, :exc:`~pywbem.TimeoutError`
            is raised.

            A value of `None` means that the connection uses the standard
            timeout behavior of Python sockets, which can be between several
            minutes and forever. Because this is somewhat unpredictable,
            it is recommended to specify a value for the timeout.

            A value of ``0`` means the timeout is very short, and does not
            really make any sense.

            Note that not all situations can be handled within this timeout, so
            for some issues, operations may take longer before raising an
            exception.

          use_pull_operations (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the use of pull operations in any `Iter...()` methods.

            *New in pywbem 0.11 as experimental and finalized in 0.13.*

            `None` means that the `Iter...()` methods will attempt a pull
            operation first, and if the WBEM server does not support it, will
            use a traditional operation from then on, on this connection.
            This detection is performed for each pull operation separately, in
            order to accomodate WBEM servers that support only some of the pull
            operations. This will work on any WBEM server whether it supports
            no, some, or all pull operations. Note that as per DSP0200, WBEM
            servers need to return status code `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` if a
            pull operation is not supported. Some WBEM servers return status
            code `CIM_ERR_FAILED` in this case, which is treated by pywbem to
            also mean that the pull operation is not supported.

            `True` means that the `Iter...()` methods will only use pull
            operations. If the WBEM server does not support pull operations, a
            :exc:`~pywbem.CIMError` with status code `CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`
            (or `CIM_ERR_FAILED` for some WBEM servers) will be raised.

            `False` (default) means that the `Iter...()` methods will only use
            traditional operations.

            This parameter will be ignored when targeting a WBEM listener.

          stats_enabled (:class:`py:bool`):
            Initial enablement status for maintaining statistics about the
            WBEM operations executed via this connection.

            *New in pywbem 0.11 as experimental, renamed from `enable_stats`
            and finalized in 0.12.*

            See the :ref:`WBEM operation statistics` section for details.

            This parameter will be ignored when targeting a WBEM listener.

          proxies (:class:`py:dict`):
            Dictionary with the URLs of HTTP or SOCKS proxies to use for
            the connection to the WBEM server or WBEM listener.

            *New in pywbem 1.0*

            `None` (the default) causes the use of direct connections without
            using a proxy.

            An input dictionary is copied.

            This parameter is passed on to the `proxies` parameter of the
            requests package. See the :ref:`Proxy support` section for details.

        Configure the pywbem loggers and optionally activate WBEM connections
        for logging and setting a log detail level.

        Parameters:

          simple_name (:term:`string`):
            Simple name (ex. `'api'`) of the single pywbem logger this method
            should affect, or `'all'` to affect all pywbem loggers.

            Must be one of the strings in
            :data:`~pywbem._logging.LOGGER_SIMPLE_NAMES`.

          log_dest (:term:`string`):
            Log destination for the affected pywbem loggers, controlling the
            configuration of its Python logging parameters (log handler,
            message format, and log level).

            If it is a :term:`string`, it must be one of the strings in
            :data:`~pywbem._logging.LOG_DESTINATIONS` and the Python logging
            parameters of the loggers will be configured accordingly for their
            log handler, message format, and with a logging level of
            :attr:`py:logging.DEBUG`.

            If `None`, the Python logging parameters of the loggers will not be
            changed.

          detail_level (:term:`string` or :class:`int` or `None`):
            Detail level for the data in each log record that is generated by
            the affected pywbem loggers.

            If it is a :term:`string`, it must be one of the strings in
            :data:`~pywbem._logging.LOG_DETAIL_LEVELS` and the loggers will
            be configured for the corresponding detail level.

            If it is an :class:`int`, it defines the maximum size of the log
            records created and the loggers will be configured to output all
            available information up to that size.

            If `None`, the detail level configuration will not be changed.

          log_filename (:term:`string`):
            Path name of the log file (required if the log destination is
            `'file'`; otherwise ignored).

          connection (:class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` or :class:`py:bool` or `None`):
            WBEM connection(s) that should be affected for activation and for
            setting the detail level.

            If it is a :class:`py:bool`, the information for activating logging
            and for the detail level of the affected loggers will be stored for
            use by subsequently created :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` objects.
            A value of `True` will store the information to activate the
            connections for logging, and will add the detail level for the
            logger(s).
            A value of `False` will reset the stored information for future
            connections to be deactivated with no detail levels specified.

            If it is a :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object, logging will be
            activated for that WBEM connection only and the specified detail
            level will be set for the affected pywbem loggers on the
            connection.

            If `None`, no WBEM connection will be activated for logging.

        propagate (:class:`py:bool`): Flag controlling whether the
          affected pywbem logger should propagate log events to its
          parent loggers.

        Raises:

                           DeepInheritance=None, IncludeQualifiers=None,
                           IncludeClassOrigin=None, PropertyList=None):
        # pylint: disable=invalid-name,line-too-long
        """
        Enumerate the instances of a class (including instances of its
        subclasses) in a namespace.

        This method performs the EnumerateInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
            attribute will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Returns:

            A list of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` objects that are
            representations of the enumerated instances.

            The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
            object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
            attributes set as follows:

            * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
            * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
            * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
            * `host`: `None`, indicating the WBEM server is unspecified.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the instance to be retrieved.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited properties are basically excluded, but the
              behavior may be WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` and should be
            set to `False` by the caller.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instance, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instance (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Returns:

            A :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` object that is a representation of
            the retrieved instance.
            Its `path` attribute is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object
            with its attributes set as follows:

            * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.

        """
        Modify the property values of an instance.

        This method performs the ModifyInstance operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        The `PropertyList` parameter determines the set of properties that are
        designated to be modified (see its description for details).

        The properties provided in the `ModifiedInstance` parameter specify
        the new property values for the properties that are designated to be
        modified.

        Pywbem sends the property values provided in the `ModifiedInstance`
        parameter to the WBEM server as provided; it does not add any default
        values for properties not provided but designated to be modified, nor
        does it reduce the properties by those not designated to be modified.

        The properties that are actually modified by the WBEM server as a result
        of this operation depend on a number of things:

        * The WBEM server will reject modification requests for key properties
          and for properties that are not exposed by the creation class of the
          target instance.

        * The WBEM server may consider some properties as read-only, as a
          result of requirements at the CIM modeling level (schema or
          management profiles), or as a result of an implementation decision.

          Note that the WRITE qualifier on a property is not a safe indicator
          as to whether the property can actually be modified. It is an
          expression at the level of the CIM schema that may or may not be
          considered in DMTF management profiles or in implementations.
          Specifically, a qualifier value of True on a property does not
          guarantee modifiability of the property, and a value of False does
          not prevent modifiability.

        * The WBEM server may detect invalid new values or conflicts resulting
          from the new property values and may reject modification of a property
          for such reasons.

        If the WBEM server rejects modification of a property for any reason,
        it will cause this operation to fail and will not modify any property
        on the target instance. If this operation succeeds, all properties
        designated to be modified have their new values (see the description
        of the `ModifiedInstance` parameter for details on how the new values
        are determined).

        Note that properties (including properties not designated to be
        modified) may change their values as an indirect result of this
        operation. For example, a property that was not designated to be
        modified may be derived from another property that was modified, and
        may show a changed value due to that.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ModifiedInstance (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
            A representation of the modified instance, also indicating its
            instance path.

            The `path` attribute of this object identifies the instance to be
            modified. Its `keybindings` attribute is required. If its
            `namespace` attribute is `None`, the default namespace of the
            connection will be used. Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            The `classname` attribute of the instance path and the `classname`
            attribute of the instance must specify the same class name.

            The properties defined in this object specify the new property
            values (including `None` for NULL). If a property is designated to
            be modified but is not specified in this object, the WBEM server
            will use the default value of the property declaration if specified
            (including `None`), and otherwise may update the property to any
            value (including `None`).

            Typically, this object has been retrieved by other operations,
            such as :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.GetInstance`.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be modified as specified in the
            `ModifiedInstance` parameter, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers not modified.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are modified if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be modified.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            This parameter defines which properties are designated to be
            modified.

            This parameter is an iterable specifying the names of the
            properties, or a string that specifies a single property name. In
            all cases, the property names are matched case insensitively.
            The specified properties are designated to be modified. Properties
            not specified are not designated to be modified.

            An empty iterable indicates that no properties are designated to be
            modified.

            If `None`, DSP0200 states that the properties with values different
            from the current values in the instance are designated to be
            modified, but for all practical purposes this is equivalent to
            stating that all properties exposed by the instance are designated
            to be modified.

            class for the new instance.

            Apart from utilizing its namespace, the `path` attribute is ignored.

            The `properties` attribute of this object specifies initial
            property values for the new CIM instance.

            Instance-level qualifiers have been deprecated in CIM, so any
            qualifier values specified using the `qualifiers` attribute
            of this object will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            *New in pywbem 0.9.*

            If `None`, defaults to the namespace in the `path` attribute of the
            `NewInstance` parameter, or to the default namespace of the
            connection.

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

        Returns:

            A :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object that is the instance
            path of the new instance, with classname, keybindings and
            namespace set.

        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ObjectName:
            The object path of the source object, selecting instance-level or
            class-level use of this operation, as follows:

            * For selecting instance-level use: The instance path of the
              source instance, as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object.
              If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
              of the connection is used.
              Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            * For selecting class-level use: The class path of the source
              class, as a :term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object:

              If specified as a string, the string is interpreted as a class
              name in the default namespace of the connection
              (case independent).

              If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
              attribute will be ignored. If this object does not specify
              a namespace, the default namespace of the connection is used.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` for
            instance-level use. WBEM servers may either implement this
            parameter as specified, or may treat any specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes) (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Returns:

            : The returned list of objects depend on the usage:

            * For instance-level use: A list of
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` objects that are representations
              of the associated instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                information.

            * For class-level use: A list of :class:`py:tuple` of
              (classpath, class) objects that are representations of the
              associated classes.

              Each tuple represents one class and has these items:

              * classpath (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`): The class
                path of the class, with its attributes set as follows:

                * `classname`: Name of the class.
                * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the class.
                * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                  the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                  information.

              * class (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClass`): The representation of the
                class, with its `path` attribute set to the `classpath` tuple

        Retrieve the association instances that reference a source instance,

        This method performs the References operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          ObjectName:
            The object path of the source object, selecting instance-level or
            class-level use of this operation, as follows:

            * For selecting instance-level use: The instance path of the
              source instance, as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object.
              If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
              of the connection is used.
              Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            * For selecting class-level use: The class path of the source
              class, as a :term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object:

              If specified as a string, the string is interpreted as a class
              name in the default namespace of the connection
              (case independent).

              If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
              attribute will be ignored. If this object does not specify
              a namespace, the default namespace of the connection is used.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes), as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if the WBEM server implements
              support for this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. Clients
            cannot rely on qualifiers to be returned in this operation.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances (or classes), as
            follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200` for
            instance-level use. WBEM servers may either implement this
            parameter as specified, or may treat any specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (or classes) (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

        Returns:

            : The returned list of objects depend on the usage:

            * For instance-level use: A list of
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance` objects that are representations
              of the referencing association instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.

              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                information.

            * For class-level use: A list of :class:`py:tuple` of
              (classpath, class) objects that are representations of the
              referencing association classes.

              Each tuple represents one class and has these items:

              * classpath (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`): The class
                path of the class, with its attributes set as follows:

                * `classname`: Name of the class.
                * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the class.
                * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                  the CIM namespace, or `None` if the server did not return host
                  information.

              * class (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClass`): The representation of the

        checking for duplicate parameter names.

        Parameters:

          MethodName (:term:`string`):
            Name of the method to be invoked (case independent).

          ObjectName:
            The object path of the target object, as follows:

            * For instance-level use: The instance path of the target
              instance, as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object.
              If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
              of the connection is used.
              Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

            * For class-level use: The class path of the target class, as a
              :term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object:

              If specified as a string, the string is interpreted as a class
              name in the default namespace of the connection
              (case independent).

              If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
              attribute will be ignored. If this object does not specify
              a namespace, the default namespace of the connection is used.

          Params (:term:`py:iterable`):
            An iterable of input parameter values for the CIM method. Each item
            in the iterable is a single parameter value and can be any of:

            * :class:`~pywbem.CIMParameter` representing a parameter value. The
              `name`, `value`, `type` and `embedded_object` attributes of this
              object are used.

            * tuple of name, value, with:

                - name (:term:`string`): Parameter name (case independent)
                - value (:term:`CIM data type`): Parameter value

          **params :
            Each keyword parameter is an additional input parameter value for
            the CIM method, with:

            * key (:term:`string`): Parameter name (case independent)
            * value (:term:`CIM data type`): Parameter value

        Returns:

            A :class:`py:tuple` of (returnvalue, outparams), with these
            tuple items:

            * returnvalue (:term:`CIM data type`):
              Return value of the CIM method.
            * outparams (:ref:`NocaseDict`):
              Dictionary with all provided output parameters of the CIM method,
              with:

              * key (:term:`unicode string`):
                Parameter name, preserving its lexical case
              * value (:term:`CIM data type`):
                Parameter value

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        This method uses the corresponding pull operations if supported by the
        WBEM server or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation.
        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether or not the WBEM server
        supports pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instances from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instances that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstances`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` init parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will cause the
          request to be rejected if the corresponding traditional operation is
          used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls the exclusion of inherited properties from the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, inherited properties are not excluded.
            * If `True`, the behavior depends on the underlying operation:
              If pull operations are used, inherited properties are not
              excluded. If traditional operations are used, inherited
              properties are basically excluded, but the behavior may be
              WBEM server specific.
            * If `None`, the behavior depends on the underlying operation:
              If pull operations are used, inherited properties are not
              excluded. If traditional operations are used, this parameter is
              not passed to the WBEM server, and causes the server-implemented
              default to be used. :term:`DSP0200` defines that the
              server-implemented default is `True`, i.e. to exclude inherited
              properties.

            :term:`DSP0200` has deprecated this parameter for the traditional
            operation and does not support it for the pull operation.

            This parameter should be set to `False` by the caller.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if this method uses
              traditional operations and the WBEM server implements support for
              this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            If this method uses pull operations, this parameter will be ignored,
            not passed to the WBEM server, and the returned instances will not
            contain any qualifiers.
            If this method uses traditional operations, clients cannot rely
            on returned instances containing qualifiers, as described in
            :term:`DSP0200`.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of

        Enumerate the instance paths of instances of a class (including
        instances of its subclasses) in a namespace, using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        This method uses the corresponding pull operations if supported by the
        WBEM server or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation.

        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instance paths from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instance paths that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstancePaths` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstanceNames`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` init parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instance paths.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero paths
              are to be returned for every request issued.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

            The choice of MaxObjectCount is client/server dependent but choices
            between 100 and 1000 typically do not have a significant impact on
            either memory or overall efficiency.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instance paths.
          These instance paths always include their host and namespace
          components. When this method uses the
          EnumerateInstancesNames operation, the host name is inserted into
          the response from the WBEMConnection.host attribute because DMTF
          EnumerateInstanceNames does not return host name in the response.

        Retrieve the instances associated to a source instance, using the
        Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        This method uses the corresponding pull operations if supported by the
        WBEM server or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation.
        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instances from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instances that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenAssociatorInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.Associators`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` init parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if this method uses
              traditional operations and the WBEM server implements support for
              this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            If this method uses pull operations, this parameter will be ignored
            and the returned instances will not contain any qualifiers.
            If this method uses traditional operations, clients cannot rely
            on returned instances containing qualifiers, as described in
            :term:`DSP0200`.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

            Many WBEM servers do not support this request attribute so that
            setting it to `True` is NOT recommended except in special cases.

            If this parameter is `True` and the traditional operation is used
            by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be raised.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instances.
          These instances include an instance path that has its host and
          namespace components set.

        Raises:

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenAssociatorInstancePaths` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.AssociatorNames`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` init parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration
              after sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instance paths.
          These instance paths have their host and namespace components set.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        Retrieve the association instances that reference a source instance,
        using the Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to return the result.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        This method uses the corresponding pull operations if supported by the
        WBEM server or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation.
        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instances from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instances that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenReferenceInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.References`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` init parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included if this method uses
              traditional operations and the WBEM server implements support for
              this parameter.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            If this method uses pull operations, this parameter will be ignored
            and the returned instances will not contain any qualifiers.
            If this method uses traditional operations, clients cannot rely
            on returned instances containing qualifiers, as described in
            :term:`DSP0200`.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):

        Retrieve the instance paths of the association instances that reference
        a source instance, using the Python :term:`py:generator` idiom to
        return the result.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        This method uses the corresponding pull operations if supported by the
        WBEM server or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation.
        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        This method is a generator function that retrieves instance paths from
        the WBEM server and returns them one by one (using :keyword:`yield`)
        when the caller iterates through the returned generator object. The
        number of instance paths that are retrieved from the WBEM server in one
        request (and thus need to be materialized in this method) is up to the
        `MaxObjectCount` parameter if the corresponding pull operations are
        used, or the complete result set all at once if the corresponding
        traditional operation is used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenReferenceInstancePaths` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.ReferenceNames`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` init parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Filtering is not supported for the corresponding traditional
          operation so that setting the `FilterQuery` or `FilterQueryLanguage`
          parameters will be rejected if the corresponding traditional
          operation is used by this method.

          Note that this limitation is not a disadvantage compared to using the
          corresponding pull operations directly, because in both cases, the
          WBEM server must support the pull operations and their filtering
          capability in order for the filtering to work.

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

            If this parameter is not `None` and the traditional operation is
            used by this method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be
            raised.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration
              after sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Returns:

          :term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`:
          A generator object that iterates the resulting CIM instance paths.
          These instance paths have their host and namespace components set.

        Execute a query in a namespace, using the Python :term:`py:generator`
        idiom to return the result.

        *New in pywbem 0.10 as experimental and finalized in 0.12.*

        This method uses the corresponding pull operations if supported by the
        WBEM server or otherwise the corresponding traditional operation.
        This method is an alternative to using the pull operations directly,
        that frees the user of having to know whether the WBEM server supports
        pull operations.

        Other than the other Iter...() methods, this method does not return
        a generator object directly, but as a property of the returned object.
        The reason for this design is the additionally returned query
        result class. The generator property in the returned object is a
        generator object that returns the instances in the query result one by
        one (using :keyword:`yield`) when the caller iterates through the
        generator object. This design causes the entire query result to be
        materialized, even if pull operations are used.

        By default, this method attempts to perform the corresponding pull
        operations
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenQueryInstances` and
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstances`).
        If these pull operations are not supported by the WBEM server, this
        method falls back to using the corresponding traditional operation
        (:meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.ExecQuery`).
        Whether the WBEM server supports these pull operations is remembered
        in the :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` object (by operation type), and
        avoids unnecessary attempts to try these pull operations on that
        connection in the future.
        The `use_pull_operations` init parameter of
        :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection` can be used to control the preference
        for always using pull operations, always using traditional operations,
        or using pull operations if supported by the WBEM server (the default).

        This method provides all of the controls of the corresponding pull
        operations except for the ability to set different response sizes on
        each request; the response size (defined by the `MaxObjectCount`
        parameter) is the same for all pull operations in the enumeration
        session.

        In addition, some functionality is only available if the corresponding
        pull operations are used by this method:

        * Setting the `ContinueOnError` parameter to `True` will be rejected if
          the corresponding traditional operation is used by this method.

        The enumeration session that is opened with the WBEM server when using
        pull operations is closed automatically when the returned generator
        object is exhausted, or when the generator object is closed using its
        :meth:`~py:generator.close` method (which may also be called before the
        generator is exhausted).

        This operation waits for all of the Open/Pull operations to complete
        before returning iterated objects (all other iter operations return
        iterated objects as the Open/Pull operations each complete). That is
        because of the complexity of having to return the QueryResultClass and
        an iterator so the real purpose of the operation is just to simplify
        an operation and not to begin response processing as the Open/Pull
        results are returned (see pywbem issue #2668).

        Parameters:

          QueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            Name of the query language used in the `Query` parameter, e.g.
            "DMTF:CQL" for CIM Query Language, and "WQL" for WBEM Query
            Language. Because this is not a filter query, "DMTF:FQL" is not a
            valid query language for this request.

          Query (:term:`string`):
            Query string in the query language specified in the `QueryLanguage`
            parameter. If the Query parameter is defined and IterQueryInstances
            uses the traditional operations to execute the request an exception
            will be generated so it is best to always set
            use_pull_operations=True for connections that define a Query.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the default namespace of the connection object will be
            used.

          ReturnQueryResultClass (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls whether a class definition describing the returned
            instances will be returned.

            `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

            `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
              If the corresponding traditional operation is used by this
              method, :exc:`py:ValueError` will be raised.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return for each of
            the open and pull requests issued during the iterations over the
            returned generator object.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * Zero is not allowed; it would mean that zero instances
              are to be returned for open and all pull requests issued to the
              server.
            * The default is defined as a system config variable.
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Returns:

          :class:`~pywbem.IterQueryInstancesReturn`: An
          object with the following properties:

          * **query_result_class** (:class:`~pywbem.CIMClass`):

            The query result class, if requested via the
            `ReturnQueryResultClass` parameter.

            `None`, if a query result class was not requested.

          * **generator** (:term:`py:generator` iterating :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):

            A generator object that iterates the CIM instances representing the
            query result. These instances do not have an instance path set.

        Raises:

            Exceptions described in :class:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection`.

        Open an enumeration session to enumerate the instances of a class
        (including instances of its subclasses) in a namespace.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        *The incorrectly supported parameters `LocalOnly` and
        `IncludeQualifiers` were removed in pywbem 1.0.0.*

        This method performs the OpenEnumerateInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath` method to
        retrieve the next set of instances or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that properties added by subclasses of the specified
            class are to be included in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, properties added by subclasses are not included.
            * If `True`, properties added by subclasses are included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClasses` and
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateClassNames`
            is different.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the retrieved instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Raises:

        Open an enumeration session to enumerate the instance paths of
        instances of a class (including instances of its subclasses) in
        a namespace.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        This method performs the OpenEnumerateInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns status on the
        enumeration session and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` method to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class to be enumerated (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `namespace` attribute will be used as a default namespace as
            described for the `namespace` parameter, and its `host` attribute
            will be ignored.

          namespace (:term:`string`):
            Name of the CIM namespace to be used (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical
            case will be preserved.

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
              Representations of the retrieved instance paths, with their
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instances associated
        to a source instance.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        *The incorrectly supported parameter `IncludeQualifiers` was removed
        in pywbem 1.0.0.*

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenAssociatorInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath` method to
        retrieve the next set of instances or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **instances** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`):
              Representations of the retrieved instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenAssociatorInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` method to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          AssocClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an associated class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that associated
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          ResultRole (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the far end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals to that far
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is

            named items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
              Representations of the retrieved instance paths, with their
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the association instances
        that reference a source instance.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        *The incorrectly supported parameter `IncludeQualifiers` was removed
        in pywbem 1.0.0.*

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenReferenceInstances operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancesWithPath` method to
        retrieve the next set of instances or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property or method in the returned instances, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `False`.

            This parameter has been deprecated in :term:`DSP0200`. WBEM servers
            may either implement this parameter as specified, or may treat any
            specified value as `False`.

          PropertyList (:term:`string` or :term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            An iterable specifying the names of the properties (or a string
            that defines a single property) to be included in the returned
            instances (case independent).

            An empty iterable indicates to include no properties.

            If `None`, all properties are included.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM

        Open an enumeration session to retrieve the instance paths of
        the association instances that reference a source instance.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        This method does not support retrieving classes.

        This method performs the OpenReferenceInstancePaths operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instance paths.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Use the :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.PullInstancePaths` method to
        retrieve the next set of instance paths or the
        :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumeration` method to close the
        enumeration session before it is exhausted.

        Parameters:

          InstanceName (:class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
            The instance path of the source instance.
            If this object does not specify a namespace, the default namespace
            of the connection is used.
            Its `host` attribute will be ignored.

          ResultClass (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Class name of an association class (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals of that association
            class (or subclasses).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its
            `host` and `namespace` attributes will be ignored.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          Role (:term:`string`):
            Role name (= property name) of the source end (case independent),
            to filter the result to include only traversals from that source
            role.

            `None` means that no such filtering is peformed.

          FilterQueryLanguage (:term:`string`):
            The name of the filter query language used for the `FilterQuery`
            parameter. The DMTF-defined Filter Query Language (see
            :term:`DSP0212`) is specified as "DMTF:FQL".

            Not all WBEM servers support filtering for this operation because
            it returns instance paths and the act of the server filtering
            requires that it generate instances just for that purpose and then
            discard them.

          FilterQuery (:term:`string`):
            The filter query in the query language defined by the
            `FilterQueryLanguage` parameter.

          OperationTimeout (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Minimum time in seconds the WBEM Server shall maintain an open
            enumeration session after a previous Open or Pull request is
            sent to the client. Once this timeout time has expired, the
            WBEM server may close the enumeration session.

            * If not `None`, this parameter is sent to the WBEM server as the
              proposed timeout for the enumeration session. A value of 0
              indicates that the server is expected to never time out. The
              server may reject the proposed value, causing a
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default timeout to be used.

          ContinueOnError (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates to the WBEM server to continue sending responses
            after an error response has been sent.

            * If `True`, the server is to continue sending responses after
              sending an error response. Not all servers support continuation
              on error; a server that does not support it must send an error
              response if `True` was specified, causing
              :class:`~pywbem.CIMError` to be raised with status code
              :data:`~pywbem._cim_constants.CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
            * If `False`, the server is requested to close the enumeration after
              sending an error response.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              `False`.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server may return
            for this request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to leave the handling of any returned
              instances to a loop of Pull operations.
            * If `None`, this parameter is not passed to the WBEM server, and
              causes the server-implemented default behaviour to be used.
              :term:`DSP0200` defines that the server-implemented default is
              to return zero instances.

        Returns:

            A :func:`~py:collections.namedtuple` object containing the following
            named items:

            * **paths** (:class:`py:list` of :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName`):
              Representations of the retrieved instance paths, with their
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              NOTE: This inner tuple hides the need for a CIM namespace
              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never
              makes sense to specify a different one in subsequent
              operations on the same enumeration session.

          ReturnQueryResultClass (:class:`py:bool`):
            Controls whether a class definition describing the returned
            instances will be returned.

            `None` will cause the server to use its default of `False`.

        Retrieve the next set of instances (with instance paths) from an open
        enumeration session.

        *New in pywbem 0.9.*

        This operation can only be used on enumeration sessions that have been
        opened by one of the following methods:

        * :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenEnumerateInstances`
        * :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenAssociatorInstances`
        * :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.OpenReferenceInstances`

        This method performs the PullInstancesWithPath operation
        (see :term:`DSP0200`). See :ref:`WBEM operations` for a list of all
        methods performing such operations.

        If the operation succeeds, this method returns enumeration session
        status and optionally instances.
        Otherwise, this method raises an exception.

        Parameters:

          context (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
            A context object identifying the open enumeration session, including
            its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This object must
            have been returned by the previous open or pull operation for this
            enumeration session.

            The tuple items are:

            * server_context (:term:`string`):
              Enumeration context string returned by the server. This
              string is opaque for the client.
            * namespace (:term:`string`):
              Name of the CIM namespace being used for this enumeration session.

          MaxObjectCount (:class:`~pywbem.Uint32`):
            Maximum number of instances the WBEM server shall return
            for this request. This parameter is required for each
            Pull request.

            * If positive, the WBEM server is to return no more than the
              specified number of instances.
            * If zero, the WBEM server is to return no instances. This may
              be used by a client to reset the interoperation timer
            * `None` is not allowed.

        Returns:

              Representations of the retrieved instances.

              The `path` attribute of each :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstance`
              object is a :class:`~pywbem.CIMInstanceName` object with its
              attributes set as follows:

              * `classname`: Name of the creation class of the instance.
              * `keybindings`: Keybindings of the instance.
              * `namespace`: Name of the CIM namespace containing the instance.
              * `host`: Host and optionally port of the WBEM server containing
                the CIM namespace.

            * **eos** (:class:`py:bool`):
              Indicates whether the enumeration session is exhausted after
              this operation:

              - If `True`, the enumeration session is exhausted, and the
                server has closed the enumeration session.
              - If `False`, the enumeration session is not exhausted and the
                `context` item is the context object for the next operation on
                the enumeration session.

            * **context** (:class:`py:tuple` of server_context, namespace):
              A context object identifying the open enumeration session,
              including its current enumeration state, and the namespace. This
              object must be supplied with the next pull or close operation for
              this enumeration session.

              The tuple items are:

              * server_context (:term:`string`):
                Enumeration context string returned by the server if
                the session is not exhausted, or `None` otherwise. This string
                is opaque for the client.
              * namespace (:term:`string`):
                Name of the CIM namespace that was used for this operation.

              on subsequent operations in the enumeration session. CIM
              operations always require target namespace, but it never

            (case independent).

            Leading and trailing slash characters will be stripped. The lexical

            If `None`, the namespace of the `ClassName` parameter will be used,
            if specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object. If that is
            also `None`, the default namespace of the connection will be used.

          ClassName (:term:`string` or :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName`):
            Name of the class whose subclasses are to be retrieved
            (case independent).
            If specified as a :class:`~pywbem.CIMClassName` object, its `host`
            attribute will be ignored.

            If `None`, the top-level classes in the namespace will be
            retrieved.

          DeepInheritance (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that all (direct and indirect) subclasses of the
            specified class or of the top-level classes are to be included in

            * If `False`, only direct subclasses of the specified class or only
              top-level classes are included in the result.
            * If `True`, all direct and indirect subclasses of the specified
              class or the top-level classes and all of their direct and
              indirect subclasses are included in the result.

            Note, the semantics of the `DeepInheritance` parameter in
            :meth:`~pywbem.WBEMConnection.EnumerateInstances` is different.

          LocalOnly (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that inherited properties, methods, and qualifiers are to
            be excluded from the returned classes, as follows.

            * If `False`, inherited elements are not excluded.
            * If `True`, inherited elements are excluded.

              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

          IncludeQualifiers (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that qualifiers are to be included in the returned
            classes, as follows:

            * If `False`, qualifiers are not included.
            * If `True`, qualifiers are included.

              causes the server-implemented default to be used. :term:`DSP0200`
              defines that the server-implemented default is `True`.

          IncludeClassOrigin (:class:`py:bool`):
            Indicates that class origin information is to be included on each
            property and method in the returned classes, as follows:

            * If `False`, class origin information is not included.
            * If `True`, class origin information is included.
