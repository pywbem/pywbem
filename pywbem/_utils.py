def _ascii2(value):
    """
    A variant of the `ascii()` built-in function known from Python 3 that:

    (1) ensures ASCII-only output, and
    (2) produces a nicer formatting for use in exception and warning messages
        and other human consumption.

    This function calls `ascii()` and post-processes its output as follows:

    * For unicode strings, a leading 'u' is stripped (u'xxx' becomes 'xxx'),
      if present.

    * For byte strings, a leading 'b' is stripped (b'xxx' becomes 'xxx'),
      if present.

    * For unicode strings, non-ASCII Unicode characters in the range U+0000 to
      U+00FF are represented as '/u00hh' instead of the confusing '/xhh'
      ('/' being a backslash, 'hh' being a 2-digit hex number).

    This function correctly handles values of collection types such as list,
    tuple, dict, and set, by producing the usual Python representation string
    for them. If the type is not the standard Python type (i.e. OrderedDict
    instead of dict), the type name is also shown in the result.

    Returns:
